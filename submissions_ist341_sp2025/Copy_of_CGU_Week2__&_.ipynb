        "This totally-optional problem asks you to write two functions that implement an English-to-Pig-Latin translator...\n",
        "\n",
        "### Warm up\n",
        "+ Write ``pigletLatin(s)``, which accepts an argument that is a string s. s will be a single word consisting of lowercase letters.\n",
        "+ Then, ``pigletLatin`` should return the translation of ``s`` to \"piglet latin,\" which has these rules:\n",
        "  + If the argument has no letters at all (the empty string), your function should return the empty string\n",
        "  + If the argument begins with a vowel, the piglet latin result simply appends the string 'way' at the end. 'y' will be considered a consonant, and not a vowel, for this problem.\n",
        "  + Example: ``pigletLatin('one')`` returns ``'oneway'``\n",
        "    + Python may not print the quotes...\n",
        "  + If the argument begins with a consonant, the piglet latin result is identical to the argument, except that the argument's initial consonant is at the end of the word instead of the beginning and it's followed by the string 'ay'.\n",
        "    + Example: ``pigletLatin('be')`` returns ``'ebay'``\n",
        "+ Be sure to write at least one test using print—and one using assert!\n",
        "Of course, this is not full pig Latin, because it does not handle words beginning with multiple consonants correctly.\n",
        "  + For example, ``pigletLatin('string')`` returns ``'tringsay'``\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### The full Pig Latin challenge\n",
        "\n",
        "Ok!  \n",
        "\n",
        "The full challenge is to create a function called ``pigLatin(s)`` that handles the rules above and handles more than one initial consonant correctly in the translation to pig Latin.\n",
        "\n",
        "That is, ``pigLatin`` moves all of the initial consonants to the end of the word before adding ``'ay'``. (You will want to write and use a helper function to do this—see the hint below.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, ``pigLatin`` should handle an initial 'y' either as a consonant OR as a vowel, depending on whether the y is followed by a vowel or consonant, respectively:\n",
        "+ If an initial 'y' is followed by a vowel ('yes', 'yodel'), then the 'y' is considered a consonant.\n",
        "+ If an initial 'y' is followed by a consonant ('yttrium', element #39), then the 'y' is considered a vowel.\n",
        "+ That is, 'yes' has an initial y acting as a consonant. The word 'yttrium', however, (element #39) has an initial y acting as a vowel. (Admittedly, there aren't many 'y'-as-vowel instances: ylem, ytterbium, element #70, and Yggdrasil, a mythic tree.)\n",
