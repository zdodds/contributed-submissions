Human thinking involves memory, emotions, and real understanding, while ChatGPT is just really good at sounding like it knows what it’s talking about. That said, I think it’s already changing how we write, learn, and research, and in the next few years, it’ll probably have a big impact on education and work. I agree it’s not sentient, but I think it can definitely give the illusion of thinking.\n",
