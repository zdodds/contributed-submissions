     i could feel, but not see, the boy’s hand move as he shrugged. “i don’t know. the unexpected should be expected, no?”
     click. clack.
     i wondered how children even came up with these things. i certainly wouldn’t have been able to come up with something so illogical and far-fetched. at least they definitely aren’t lacking in creativity.
     the boy had sat down on the bed now, pulling me down with him. i asked, “then, how come everyone hasn’t been “drank” by the click clacks? i’m sure not everyone always expects the unexpected.”
     “they just got lucky.” he said ominously.
     i couldn’t think of anything else to say, so i let the silence drape over us like a curtain of darkness. it was quiet. too quiet.
     click. clack.
     i blinked and tried to will away the thought of the click clacks. the house was old, and the click clacks were probably just the creaks of the old house in the wind. the story had made me more apprehensive than i would admit. it was even making me hear things.
     i felt a prickle along my spine, like spiders crawling. i had a feeling the boy was staring at me, even in the pitch blackness of the attic. there was a rustle as he moved, then i could feel his breath against my ear.
     “but you didn’t.”
     it was but a whisper, but it chilled me to my core. my heart pounded, and i couldn’t say a word. reaching out towards the boy, i tried to grab him, but my hand just passed through air. the darkness seemed even more suffocating now.
     click. clack.
     i heard the tip-tap of footsteps, deafening in the silence. they came from all around me, cocooning me with the roar. it almost sounded like millions of spiders crawling towards me. i felt a huge presence emanating from behind me, but i couldn’t turn around. even if i did, i wouldn’t have been able to see what it was. my instincts screamed at me to run, to hide, to do something to escape. but i knew i wouldn’t be able to make it through the door. i knew i had to stay still. i knew i wouldn’t be able to escape anyways.
     click. clack.
     thousands of tiny eyes surrounded me, barely noticeable. the moment seemed to drag out for an eternity. anticipation flooded my mind with horrifying images. my heart pounded. my eyes strained. my stomach roiled and i was hyper aware of every sound, every touch, every glint of light reflecting off the eyes. then, i heard a whoosh. and the moment shattered.
     the thing grabbed my arm just as i tried to get up and flee. it pulled me towards it and the spiders, yes, the eyes were spiders, closing in on me. i struggled. i twisted. i tried to bite. but nothing could get me out of its cold embrace.
     click. clack.
     the lights flickered on for a moment, and i saw a dark shadow, vaguely humanoid. shadowy tendrils that were the spiders radiated off of it. that shadow was the thing. that, i now knew for certain, was a click clack. the lights flickered off again and i felt the click clack reach down its ‘head’. a bite. a scream. it hurt. i was scared. i was terrified. light flooded the room. then, all i could see was darkness.

     there! he saw them, unconscious, being taken into hungary by the soldiers. mahmoud stood up with shaky knees and ran over, shouting “wait! please! where are you taking them?”
     as he approached, a soldier pushed him away, making mahmoud stumble. “why don’t you just let us go through hungary? we don’t even want to stay! please!” he shouted.
     the soldier sighed, as if exasperated, and grabbed mahmoud, pulling him to where they were taking his family. he noticed waleed twitch, signaling that he was probably waking up.
     “waleed! can you try to wake mom and dad up? i don’t know where they’re taking us!”
     waleed just shrugged, nodding towards his bound arms. “who knows? maybe they’re taking us to austria.”

     he ignored mahmoud and led him towards a group of people who were also being detained. they were tied up and thrown into a van, and so was mahmoud’s family. struggling again, mahmoud tried to free his hands unsuccessfully. he was manhandled into the van, and behind him, the door closed. through the small window, he could see his surroundings move. they were headed back over the border.

# when we were reading refugee

theirs1 = """ after the movie was over it suddenly came to us that cherry and marcia
didn't have a way to get home. two-bit gallantly offered to walk them home--- the west
side of town was only about twenty miles away--- but they wanted to call their parents
and have them come and get them. two-bit finally talked them into letting us drive them
home in his car. i think they were still half-scared of us. they were getting over it,
though, as we walked to two-bit's house to pick up the car. it seemed funny to me that
socs--- if these girls were any example--- were just like us. they liked the beatles and
thought elvis presley was out, and we thought the beatles were rank and that elvis was
tuff, but that seemed the only difference to me. of course greasy girls would have acted a
lot tougher, but there was a basic sameness. i thought maybe it was money that separated
us.
"no," cherry said slowly when i said this. "it's not just money. part of it is, but
not all. you greasers have a different set of values. you're more emotional. we're
sophisticated--- cool to the point of not feeling anything. nothing is real with us. you
know, sometimes i'll catch myself talking to a girl-friend, and realize i don't mean half of
what i'm saying. i don't really think a beer blast on the river bottom is super-cool, but i'll
rave about one to a girl-friend just to be saying something." she smiled at me. "i never
told anyone that. i think you're the first person i've ever really gotten through to."
she was coming through to me all right, probably because i was a greaser, and
younger; she didn't have to keep her guard up with me.
"rat race is a perfect name for it," she said. "we're always going and going and
going, and never asking where. did you ever hear of having more than you wanted? so
that you couldn't want anything else and then started looking for something else to want?
it seems like we're always searching for something to satisfy us, and never finding it.
maybe if we could lose our cool. we could."

you know how it is, when you wake up in a strange place and wonder where in the world
you are, until memory comes rushing over you like a wave. i half convinced myself that i
had dreamed everything that had happened the night before. i'm really home in bed, i
thought. it's late and both darry and sodapop are up. darry's cooking breakfast, and in a
minute he and soda will come in and drag me out of bed and wrestle me down and tickle
me until i think i'll die if they don't stop. it's me and soda's turn to do the dishes after we
eat, and then we'll all go outside and play football. johnny and two-bit and i will get
darry on our side, since johnny and i are so small and darry's the best player. it'll go like
the usual weekend morning. i tried telling myself that while i lay on the cold rock floor,
wrapped up in dally's jacket and listening to the wind rushing through the trees' dry
leaves outside.
finally i quit pretending and pushed myself up. i was stiff and sore from sleeping
on that hard floor, but i had never slept so soundly. i was still groggy. i pushed off
johnny's jeans jacket, which had somehow got thrown across me, and blinked, scratching
my head. it was awful quiet, with just the sound of rushing wind in the trees. suddenly i
realized that johnny wasn't there.
"johnny?" i called loudly, and that old wooden church echoed me, onny onny... i
looked around wildly, almost panic-stricken, but then caught sight of some crooked
lettering written in the dust of the floor. went to get supplies. be back soon. j.c.
i sighed, and went to the pump to get a drink. the water from it was like liquid ice
and it tasted funny, but it was water. i splashed some on my face and that woke me up
pretty quick. i wiped my face off on johnny's jacket and sat down on the back steps. the
hill the church was on dropped off suddenly about twenty feet from the back door, and
you could see for miles and miles. it was like sitting on the top of the world.

import requests


#
# let's try it on a simple webpage
#

#
# we assign the url and obtain the api-call result into result
#    note that result will be an object that contains many fields (not a simple string)
#

url = "https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~dodds/demo.html"
result = requests.get(url)

# if it succeeded, you should see <response [200]>
# see the list of http reponse codes for the full set!


#
# when exploring, you'll often obtain an unfamiliar object.
# here, we'll ask what type it is
type(result)


# we can print all of the data members in an object with dir
# since dir returns a list, we will grab that list and loop over it:
all_fields = dir(result)

for field in all_fields:
    if "_" not in field:
        print(field)


#
# let's try printing a few of those fields (data members):
print(f"result.url         is {result.url}")  # the original url
print(f"result.raw         is {result.raw}")  # another object!
print(f"result.encoding    is {result.encoding}")  # utf-8 is very common
print(f"result.status_code is {result.status_code}")  # 200 is success!


# in this case, the result is a text file (html) let's see it!
contents = result.text
print(contents)


# yay!
# this shows that you are able to "scrape" an arbitrary html page...

# now, we're off to more _structured_ data-gathering...


#
# we assign the url and obtain the api-call result into result
#    note that result will be an object that contains many fields (not a simple string)
#

import requests

url = "http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json"   # this is sometimes called an "endpoint" ...
result = requests.get(url)

# if it succeeds, you should see <response [200]>


#
# let's try printing those shorter fields from before:
print(f"result.url         is {result.url}")  # the original url
print(f"result.raw         is {result.raw}")  # another object!
print(f"result.encoding    is {result.encoding}")  # utf-8 is very common
print(f"result.status_code is {result.status_code}")  # 200 is success!


#
# in this case, we know the result is a json file, and we can obtain it that way:
json_contents = result.json()
print(json_contents)

# remember:  json_contents will be a _dictionary_


#
# let's see how dictionaries work:

json_contents['message']

# thought experiment:  could we access the other components? what _types_ are they?!!


# json is a javascript dictionary format -- almost the same as a python dictionary:
data = { 'key':'value',  'fave':42,  'list':[5,6,7,{'mascot':'aliiien'}] }
print(data)


data['list']



data['list'][3]['mascot']



#
# here, we will obtain plain-text results from a request
# url = "https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~dodds/demo.html"  # try it + source
# url = "https://www.scrippscollege.edu/"          # another possible site... 403
# url = "https://www.pitzer.edu/"                  # another possible site... 200
# url = "https://www.cmc.edu/"                     # and another!             200
# url = "https://www.cgu.edu/"                       # yay cgu!               403
result = requests.get(url)
print(f"result is {result}")        # question: is the result a "200" response?!


#
# we assign the url and use requests.get to obtain the result into result_astro
#
#    remember, result_astro will be an object that contains many fields (not a simple string)
#

import requests

result_astro = requests.get(url)

# if it succeeded, you should see <response [200]>


# if the request succeeded, we know the result is a json file, and we can obtain it that way.
# let's call our dictionary something more specific:
