It doesn't daydream the way I do nor can it create or visualize the crazy insane weird things I think about. The 'thinking' that chatGPT does is essentially human input but with a massive library to derive from. It can output language, sentence structure and explain things in it's own robotic terms. This is getting a little existential but human thinking has a wider range and includes morality, POV of a living creature, and quite frankly is more creative. Being able to combine the two 'schools of thought' can definitely be powerful, however. The AI art and games industry is certainly interesting, as I think about some the most emotional and thought-provoking pieces could never be done by AI.\n",
