For example, If the user chooses \"rock\" it will print lines **13,14,15** but it does not stop there it will also go to the second if \"line **17**\" and check for the test which is fault, then it will print the else block \"lines **22,23,24**\" before it will print the last two lines **27,28**. When the user chooses \"paper\" or \"scissors\" or any other choices, it will run smoothly as the original version of the code.\n",

        "\n",
        "Language plays a significant role in shaping our perceptions and interactions with the world. For instance, I've noticed that my father frequently uses geographical directions. This is likely because he worked on my grandfather's farm as a young boy, where he was a shepherd tending to sheep in the open desert. He learned to navigate using these directions at an early age. Sometimes I find it difficult to find the location that sent me to because he uses these directions.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Interestingly, modern contexts like movies demonstrate the potential for a more universal directional system. Phrases like \"The target is at 10 o'clock\" provide a clear and intuitive way to describe spatial relationships, combining the benefits of egocentric and geographic systems. If such a system were widely adopted, it could bridge gaps between cultural and linguistic differences, making communication more efficient and universally understandable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, artificial languages like Python also shape thought processes, training us to think logically and sequentially. While programming languages do not influence perception like natural languages, they guide problem-solving strategies. Both natural and artificial languages remind us that the tools we use for communication shape how we interact with the world and one another.\n",
