# Looking for the **"All-in-one"** notebook?

It's located [here at this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19jZDFIqD-ABndSgd1EQzSl_soQ-FU4J-#scrollTo=e-xLewmU4p0s&uniqifier=1)<br>

#   Homework 8
+ clasification via decision trees and random forests...
+ which are both "the same" as k-nearest-neighbors, and
+ "the opposite" of k-nearest-neighbors!

It all hinges on how we define ***near*** .

Let's see how it works:

# Decision Trees: Iris Example<br>

#### Here is where the model-buidling begins in earnest...<br>

#### That's it! :-)<br>

#### The online tree-visualizer is at [http://viz-js.com/](http://viz-js.com/)<br>

#### <b>To try</b>:  showing the depth 2+ tree### The model is complete
+ and can predict _any_ future...
+ ... though not always correctly.
+ Let's plot many of them!# Random Forests: Iris Example### Let's see our predictive model!### Yay!  

Next up:  Births DT and RF# DT and RF: **Births** data

Next, you'll do the same thing on the births dataset...
### Suggestion:

Open this notebook twice!

**One window** so that you can go cell-by-cell through the iris-cleaning and iris-modeling cells...

**The second window** is to copy-paste-and-adapt the iris approach to the births data

The approach is identical.

The data-details are different, and that's where the adaptation is necessary and important.

Onward:These are just placeholders.

You'll copy-and-edit ***lots*** of cells from the iris example.# Data Cleaning: Births data# Data Modeling: Births data
# DT and RF: **Digits** data

Next, you'll do the same thing on the digits dataset...

Same suggestion as before!
Notice that you're getting more and more practice with the "modeling workflow."

It's not an exaggeration to say that this is, in essence, what all ML/modeling efforts look-and-feel like!# Data Cleaning: Digits data# Data Modeling: Digits data<br><br>

a placeholder text cell# **Next week**: Titanic or _your-own-data_

Not required for this week -- but for _next_ week, IST341 will be narrowing project ideas.

One of those possibilities is to choose a dataset of your own (or use the Titanic / housing dataset) and
+ be sure it's cleaned up to the point where it's "tidy"
+ the cleaning can be done in Excel/spreadsheets instead of Python, for sure
+ or, the cleaning can be done in Python -- up to you!
+ Then, model your dataset with DTs and RFs, just as above
+ and, use Neural Nets (which we will feature next week...)

To gain additional insight, you'll find and show the _feature importances_ for your features in your dataset...

Often, these are what generate the most value, because
+ you want to know what features have the most impact
+ you want to know the relative strengths of the features
+ you're waiting for future data on which to run your predictive model! :-)

You can tell we're evolving into a "final-project" mindset.

The final project does not have to be data-analysis at all. (That said, it's a popular option...) Big-picture, it's best if _whatever the project_ it overlaps with  your work or interests from professional/personal/other class's efforts.

Onward!
