However, using the browser to access the information is not 'automated', because, even thouuuuuuugh it is through whatever the browser is doing, the person is still physically controlling when and how to interact with the page. I think that as long as the person is doing at least most of the work and not relying on something else to do access and evaluate the information for them, then it is not 'automated', so webscraping would probably be considered 'automated'.
