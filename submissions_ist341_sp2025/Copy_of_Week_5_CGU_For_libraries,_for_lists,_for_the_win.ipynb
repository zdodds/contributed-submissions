        "This paper focuses on two separate case studies and how they utilize data mining tools and predictive modeling to help predict child support payment delinquency. As we have learned from the CRISP-DM framework, there are six phases that should be implemented when conducting a data mining project. These phases are:\n",
        "Business Understanding: determine business objectives, assess situation, determine data mining goals, produce project plan\n",
        "Data Understanding: collect initial data, describe data, explore data, verify data quality\n",
        "Data Preparation: data set, select data, clean data, construct data, integrate data, format data\n",
        "Modeling: select modeling technique, generate test design, build model, assess model\n",
        "Evaluation: evaluate results, review process, determine next steps\n",
        "Deployment: plan deployment, plan monitoring and maintenance, produce final report, review project\n",
        "This model is extremely helpful for anyone who is looking to complete a data mining project to reach their business goals. It is important to note that the model and its phases are visualized in a cycle. As noted in the paper, “the arrows indicate the most important and frequent dependencies between the phases, while the outer circle symbolizes the cyclical nature of data mining itself and illustrates that the lessons learned during the data mining process and from the deployed solution can trigger new, often more focused business questions” (Shearer 14). This means that this model emphasizes that in data mining, we can learn new things along the way, so we might have to go back to a previous phase to ensure we are completing our project in an effective and efficient manner.\n",
        "In each of the case studies, some of the sections described to completing this project aligns with the CRISP-DM framework, while some of the steps taken happen at a different time than described in the framework. Thus, in this report, I will be organizing each of the case studies in a manner that matches the CRISP-DM framework and its order of the phases. I will be using evidence from the text to discuss the issues covered and issues not covered in each phase listed above. After doing this, I will summarize the benefits and weaknesses revealed in each case study. Lastly, I will conclude what I have learned from the case studies and how it aligns with the CRISP-DM framework.\n",

The plan is to design intervention policies and programs that can help improve compliance of completing child care payments. The paper also states that historical data will be utilized to train and fine tune a predictive model making it clear that using data mining can help with decision-making and improving enforcement strategies. Another issue that is covered is that key stakeholders and their impact are mentioned. Agencies and policymakers involved with child support enforcement will use the insights gained from the project to help in the reduction of delinquency in child care payments by creating the most efficient and effective policies and programs possible.\n",

As such, they were also in the initial stages of both collecting and cleansing data. One of the main benefits of mining at this stage is recognizing what data is available, necessary, and useful.

        "Here, the case study defines and outlines the business objectives of the data mining project.\n",
        "“Initially, the most important data issue for the problem definition for State B was whether to model at the case level or at the NCP level. This state can only take legal actions on an NCP by case. However, because we were ultimately trying to model the behavior of an individual and not a case, we decided to compile the data at the NCP level.”\n",

        "To improve the accuracy of the predictions, alternative target variable definitions are tested and refined.\n",
        "“State B sought to gain additional data points. The state enforcement agency was able to purchase a financial score from a major credit reporting agency for a number of their cases.

        "Marvel Universe Social Network Analysis and Report\n",
        "\n",
        "Introduction and Research Question(s)\n",
        "The Marvel Universe is one of the most interconnected fictional worlds ever created, encompassing over 6,000 characters across comics, films, television, and other media. Its complex narrative structure, characterized by a web of alliances, rivalries, and collaborations, provides a unique opportunity to study network dynamics within a fictional framework. While it may initially appear as mere entertainment, the Marvel Universe functions as a dynamic social network where characters are the nodes, and their interactions form the edges. This intricate structure is not just a storytelling mechanism but also a reflection of real-world social systems. Analyzing this network enables researchers to uncover patterns of influence, hierarchy, and community, much like those observed in human societies.This study focuses on two pivotal research questions:\n",
        "\n",
        "Who are the most influential and central characters in the Marvel Universe based on centrality measures?\n",
        "What clusters of superheroes emerge using community detection algorithms?\n",
        "\n",
        "The first research question seeks to identify key characters who serve as connectors or hubs within the network. Centrality measures such as degree, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality offer insights into the importance of specific nodes in a network. Characters like Spider-Man and Iron Man, for example, are known to interact with diverse groups across the Marvel Universe, making them central figures in terms of influence and connectivity. Identifying these central characters allows us to understand which superheroes act as bridges between different communities, enabling collaboration and driving the overarching narrative. These insights can reveal the storytelling strategies employed by Marvel’s writers, who often design central characters to play pivotal roles in uniting disparate groups during major crossover events or conflicts.\n",
        "The second research question delves into the natural clustering of superheroes within the Marvel Universe. Using community detection algorithms, we can uncover groups or clusters of characters that form based on shared traits, missions, or narrative arcs. These clusters often represent well-known superhero teams such as the Avengers, X-Men, or Guardians of the Galaxy, each characterized by dense internal connections and distinct roles within the broader network. For example, the X-Men cluster frequently highlights themes of inclusion and fighting for civil rights, while the Avengers cluster focuses on leadership, teamwork, and the challenges of managing powerful personalities. Beyond established teams, community detection can reveal unexpected alliances or subgroups, providing insights into how Marvel’s creators structure relationships to enhance narrative complexity and depth.\n",
        "The rationale for this research lies in the parallel between fictional superhero networks and real-world social systems. Just as human social networks exhibit certain patterns—such as small-world phenomena, preferential attachment, and high transitivity—these patterns are likely mirrored in the Marvel Universe. For instance, small-world networks are characterized by short path lengths, allowing for efficient communication and interaction among nodes. Similarly, preferential attachment explains why certain nodes, such as popular characters, attract more connections over time, reinforcing their centrality in the network. High transitivity, or the tendency for nodes to form tightly connected clusters, mirrors the cohesive nature of superhero teams. By analyzing these features within the Marvel Universe, we can gain insights into the storytelling mechanisms that make these narratives so compelling and relatable to audiences.\n",
        "Furthermore, this research contributes to a broader understanding of how fictional networks are crafted to resonate with real-world social dynamics. Marvel’s writers often use interconnected narratives to create a sense of continuity and interdependence, emphasizing themes of teamwork, leadership, and the balance of individual and collective goals. These themes are central to human experiences, making the Marvel Universe a mirror of the societies we live in. By exploring how characters interact and influence one another, this study not only enhances our appreciation of the Marvel Universe but also illustrates the relevance of network theory in analyzing both fictional and real-world systems.\n",
        "Ultimately, the analysis of the Marvel Universe as a superhero network bridges the gap between entertainment and academic inquiry. It underscores the value of applying social network theory to understand the dynamics of fictional worlds and their reflection of societal structures. By answering the proposed research questions, this study aims to illuminate the roles of central characters, the formation of superhero clusters, and the broader implications of these dynamics for storytelling and cultural representation. In doing so, it demonstrates how the Marvel Universe serves as a fascinating microcosm for exploring the complexity of human and superhuman relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "Popularity and Cultural Impact of Comics\n",
        "Comics, especially superhero narratives, have captivated audiences for decades due to their ability to combine action, moral dilemmas, and relatable themes. They provide escapism while tackling universal issues such as justice, resilience, and societal conflict. Scholars like McCloud (1993) emphasize the unique power of comics to blend visual and textual storytelling, creating immersive experiences that resonate emotionally with readers. Superheroes themselves serve as cultural icons, embodying the ideals, struggles, and aspirations of the eras in which they were created. From Captain America's patriotic symbolism during World War II to the inclusive narratives surrounding heroes like Black Panther and Ms. Marvel, these characters have provided a platform for societal commentary and the representation of diverse perspectives. Moreover, the appeal of superhero narratives lies in their emphasis on community and connection—heroes rarely work in isolation but are part of larger networks of allies and adversaries. Also, superhero stories often extend beyond entertainment, offering nuanced critiques of social issues. The X-Men, for example, are frequently interpreted as allegories for marginalized communities, exploring themes of acceptance and prejudice. Similarly, Avengers storylines highlight themes of teamwork and leadership, while inter-team rivalries reflect real-world political and ideological conflicts. These elements make the Marvel Universe not only a fictional narrative but also a lens through which societal dynamics are examined.\n",
        "\n",
        "Social Network Theory and its Application to Marvel\n",
        "Social network theory offers a robust framework for analyzing the complex relationships within the Marvel Universe. At its core, the theory posits that individual actors (nodes) are interconnected through relationships (edges), forming networks that influence behaviors, roles, and outcomes. Within the superhero network, centrality measures such as degree, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality help identify influential characters who act as connectors or hubs, linking disparate groups and facilitating collaboration.\n",
        "Furthermore, community detection algorithms, grounded in modularity optimization, uncover clusters of superheroes—groups of characters with dense internal connections but fewer ties to the rest of the network. These clusters often reflect narrative dynamics, such as teams like the Avengers or X-Men, and provide insights into the storytelling strategies that highlight collaboration and conflict.\n",
        "The study of the Marvel superhero network through these lenses allows us to explore how fictional worlds emulate real-world social structures. Just as individuals in human social networks play distinct roles—leaders, brokers, or peripheral actors—superheroes fulfill similar functions within their universe. This analysis not only deepens our understanding of the Marvel Universe but also illustrates the power of social network theory in unraveling the complexity of human (and superhuman) relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "Description of the Dataset\n",
        "Obtaining from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/csanhueza/the-marvel-universe-social-network), this is how the data set looks like:\n",
        "\n",
        "The data set is a 574,467 by 2 table which contains the network of heroes which appear together in the comics. This structure suggests that the dataset could be used to construct a social network, where each hero serves as a node, and the interactions between them form edges connecting these nodes. This format is particularly suitable for studying various network-based attributes, such as five-number summary, key influences, or community detection.\n",
        "\n",
        "Network Visualization(s)\n",
        "We found that, after creating a social network using the data set, our network has four connected components where one of them is particularly large and the other three are negligible as they only have 18 vertices combined. The following is the largest connected component of the network and another one below it is the same network with community detection.\n",
        "\n",
        "Social Network Analysis of the Marvel Universe\n",
        "As mentioned before, the Marvel Universe is a fictional realm made up of hundreds of characters, storylines, and relationships. The network is filled with characters that interact with each other through different movies, comics, and series, which we can explore through social network analysis tools in R. In our social network analysis, we computed the five-number summary, centrality measures, and community detection. We can utilize these tools to answer our questions about who the most influential superheroes are and what community detection can tell us about the Marvel Universe.\n",
        "The first thing we did was import the necessary data to analyze the Marvel Universe. Then, we needed to convert the CSV to a graph, which allows us to do the necessary computations.\n",
        "# import data\n",

        "Community Detection\n",
        "Using the Walktrap algorithm, we identified 273 communities, each representing groups of heroes with frequent interactions. Examples include:\n",
        "Avengers: Led by Iron Man and Captain America.\n",
        "X-Men: Centered around Wolverine, Cyclops, and Storm.\n",
        "Fantastic Four: Featuring Mr. Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch, and The Thing.\n",

        "Implications for Theory\n",
        "\n",
        "Leadership and Centrality\n",
        "The high centrality values of characters like Captain America and Iron Man demonstrate that leadership traits—such as the ability to inspire and unite—are integral to network influence. This supports theories emphasizing the role of connectors and bridges in sustaining network cohesion and facilitating communication.\n",
        "\n",
        "Community Formation and Modularity\n",
        "The detection of 273 communities aligns with theories of modular networks, where tightly connected subgroups coexist within larger systems. Marvel's communities reflect real-world dynamics, such as shared goals, geographic proximity, and common traits or experiences. This supports the homophily principle, which posits that individuals with similar characteristics or goals are more likely to form connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "Small-World Effect\n",
        "The small diameter and reliance on central nodes confirm the small-world phenomenon, where information or influence can spread efficiently across even sparse networks. This theoretical concept is vital for understanding social systems, emphasizing the importance of global connectivity over dense local clustering.\n",
        "\n",
        "Implications for Practice\n",
        "Leadership Development\n",
        "Understanding the traits of central heroes can inform leadership training:\n",
        "Encouraging leaders to act as connectors by bridging isolated groups.\n",
        "Fostering traits like inspiration and collaboration, seen in Captain America's ability to unite diverse teams.\n",
        "Organizations can cultivate leaders who not only excel in direct interactions but also influence and connect broader systems.\n",
        "Team Building\n",
        "Marvel's community dynamics offer insights into group formation:\n",
        "Teams formed around shared goals or geographic proximity are likely to perform well.\n",
        "Crossovers between groups reflect the importance of inter-team communication in fostering innovation and resilience.\n",
        "Practically, this can guide workplace collaboration strategies, such as forming project teams with complementary skill sets or encouraging inter-departmental networking.\n",
        "Marketing and Storytelling\n",
        "Marvel's network structure provides a blueprint for engaging audiences:\n",
        "Characters like Spider-Man and Wolverine, who frequently collaborate, can anchor cross-team storylines or marketing campaigns.\n",
        "Community overlaps suggest opportunities for bundled products or events appealing to fans of multiple teams.\n",
        "Digital and Organizational Networks\n",
        "Insights from Marvel's network can inform digital platforms and organizational structures:\n",
        "Social media recommendation algorithms can mimic the small-world effect to connect users efficiently.\n",
        "Organizations can design structures that balance modularity (team specialization) with global connectivity (inter-department collaboration).\n",
        "\n",
        "Conclusion\n",
        "The analysis of the Marvel superhero network bridges theory and practice, offering insights into leadership, group dynamics, and efficient connectivity. Heroes like Captain America and Spider-Man exemplify key roles as connectors and influencers, reflecting traits valued in real-world leaders. The modular community structure mirrors how human groups form around shared traits or goals, emphasizing universal principles of collaboration. These findings not only deepen our understanding of network science but also provide actionable strategies for enhancing leadership, storytelling, and organizational efficiency in various fields.\n",
