        "There have been instances where language has been a barrier to my ability to achieve something. One example was in my early academic years when I had to present research in English, which is not my first language. Even though I had a strong grasp of the subject, I found it challenging to express my ideas with the same fluency and precision as I could in my native language. The limitations of language became clear when I struggled to communicate complex thoughts because of a limited vocabulary and differences in sentence structure. Another instance occurred during my travels, particularly in areas where directions were given based on landmarks instead of formal addresses. In some cultures, people refer to cardinal directions, while in others, they use relative terms like left or right. This difference occasionally led to confusion, showing how language influences our understanding of space and navigation. I think these examples from my experiences reflect the article‚Äôs argument about how language shapes thought and how we interact with the world.\n",
