## Here's our _one-cell_ version of the ML workflow <font color="Coral"><b>let's start here. IST341_Participant_8</b></font> &nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="-2">"amoeba version," maybe</font>

This is for iris classification.  You'll run ML on the births and digits!
### <b>Data reminder</b>

In Colab, be sure to upload your <tt>.csv</tt> cleaned data file.

For example, to run the cell below you will need the <tt>iris_cleaned.csv</tt> file -- it's [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Qnie8N2VCdumwaFxFldJ_1iQmvtb40pZ?usp=drive_link)

Download it to your machine and then upload it to Colab into the _folder_ &nbsp; icon at left.### Iris classification via Nearest Neighbors

+ Section 1: Libraries
+ Section 2: Read the already-cleaned data  (+ view, if you wish)
+ Section 3:  Drop any columns we don't want to use
+ Section 4:  create COLUMNS and SPECIES variables to show we're organized + know what's happening...
+ Section 5:  convert from pandas (spreadsheet) to numpy (array)
+ Section 6:  define our features (X_all) and our target-to-predict (y_all)
+ Section 7:  80/20 split into training and testing sets:  X_train and y_train, X_test and y_test
+ Section 8:  Here's where the model-building happens!  First, we guess at the parameters (k=84)
+ Section 9:  Let's see how our model does on the TEST data...
+ Section 10:  Let's cross-validate to find the "best" value of k, best_k
+ Section 11:  Let's build a final model + and see it!### Optional:  Let's format things more carefully...### <b><font color="DodgerBlue">We did it!</font></b>: &nbsp; Now, let's use the predictive model!

We can use the predictive model to make predictions and try it out!### This feels like an excuse to plot with seaborn...### Let's use the "correct value" of k

It will not always be the same, because cross-validation is randomized...### We're ready to deploy our "final + best" predictive model!### Predictive models aren't perfect!
+ Notice that the last prediction above the [0,0,0,0] is (probably) wrong
  + It probably predicted _versicolor_, but it was actually a _virginica_
  + In essence, it was a _virginica_ iris that "looked more like" a _versicolor_ ... ***from these four features!***
  + A botanist would use more than these four features to classify difference species...

+ **Key**: Even when the modeling process runs "perfectly," the models are likely to be imperfect...
+ ... it's just that we won't know where the imperfections are -- until future observations arrive!### That's it! Our model is complete...

... not perfect, but **complete**

What does this mean?

It means that the model -- the function (above) -- is ***already*** prepared to provide an output for every possible input!

We can see this in a plot of the outputs for every input in the "sepal" plane (length vs. width) as well as the "petal" plane:We've done it!

Remember that the model _thinks_ it knows everything...

But it's way too confident! &nbsp;&nbsp; (This seems like an AI theme...)<br>
<hr>
<br># Your tasks!

Based on the examples above, your task is to build a kNN model (along with the tests and visualizations) for two datasets:

*   the births dataset and
*   the digits dataset

<br>
<hr>
<br>

Suggestion:  Perhaps open this notebook twice...

_Then you can copy-paste-adapt the iris workflow to each new dataset!_

<br>
<hr>
<br>

As optional EC, track down another dataset of your own choosing and build a DT+RF model  

Notice that this can be an excellent final project, too! ðŸ˜ƒ
