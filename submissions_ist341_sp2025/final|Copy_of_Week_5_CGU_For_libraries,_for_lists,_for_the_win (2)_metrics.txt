fundamentals of petroleum quality management
1-35. contaminated, comingled, or dirty fuels can damage expensive engines and cause the failure of criticalcombat missions. quality management is the responsibility of every element that receives, stores, and issues
chapter 1
1-8 atp 4-43 18 april 2022
bulk fuel. quality management includes two subsets - quality assurance and quality surveillance. quality assurance determine if the bulk fuel producer or supplier complies with the required specifications detailed in the contract. quality assurance takes place at the strategic level and is primarily a dla energy function. quality surveillance ensures the on specification fuel provided to the service is acceptable for the intended use until consumed. quality surveillance is a service task performed by qualified personnel using approved petroleum laboratories and test kits across the area of operations.
quality assurance
1-36. quality assurance is a planned and systematic pattern of all actions necessary to provide confidencethat adequate technical requirements are established; products and services conform to established technicalrequirements; and satisfactory performance is achieved. for the government, contract quality assurance is amethod to determine if a supplier of products or services fulfilled its contract obligations pertaining toproducts or services provided. it includes all actions required to ensure the government is receiving theproper products and services. by common usage, contract quality assurance responsibility is fulfilled whenthe product or service is accepted by the government and the product no longer belongs to the contractor orthe service is complete.
quality surveillance
1-37. quality surveillance is the aggregate of measures (such as blending, stock rotation, and sampling) usedto determine and maintain the quality of product receipts and government-owned bulk petroleum productsto the degree necessary to ensure that such products are suitable for their intended use. quality surveillancetakes place at the strategic, operational and tactical levels. sediment, water, microbial growth, andcommingled fuel may damage aircraft, ground vehicles, and fuel storage equipment. contaminated ordeteriorated fuel can cost lives, especially with aircraft.
1-38. a robust, detailed quality surveillance program ensures fuel used in military equipment is clean (clear)and bright and suitable for immediate use for its intended purpose. quality surveillance applies to allpetroleum products, and is the responsibility of all personnel who handle petroleum. quality surveillancetests performed depend on where the bulk fuel is in the distribution network. the minimum qualitysurveillance tests required for each fuel type and location are provided in mil-std-3004-1a. army specificquality surveillance guidance can be found within da pam 710-2-1 and ar 710-2. in addition to ensuringpetroleum issued is suitable for use, quality surveillance provides insight into how well equipment andproducts are being maintained.
1-39. daily quality surveillance of petroleum storage and distribution systems is essential to detect leaks,sabotage, damage, pilferage, unintended product comingling, contamination, and deterioration duringstorage. qualified fuel handlers and petroleum laboratory specialists perform and supervise qualitysurveillance throughout the army petroleum distribution network. quality surveillance is the responsibilityof every element in the distribution network that receives, stores, and issues bulk fuel.
1-40. quality surveillance and sampling of bulk fuel is necessary to ensure that quality products are supplied.fuel handlers and petroleum laboratory specialists personnel take samples of products for testing as follows:
upon receipt.
daily prior to use.
when requested by petroleum offices.
bulk fuel stored for six months or more. refer to ar 710-2 and mil-std-3004-1a.
the quality of fuel is questioned or it cannot be classified.
a filter separator is first placed in service after the filter-coalescer elements have been changedand within 30 days from the date last sampled from that filter separator.
it is reasonably suspected that an aviation fuel may be contaminated or commingled.
commercial deliveries of bulk fuel. refer to da pam 710-2-1 and mil-std-3004-1a.

    i'll never do you wrong for your own sake.
    blessing upon your vows; and in your bed
    find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!
  lafeu. these boys are boys of ice; they'll none have her.
    sure, they are bastards to the english; the french ne'er got 'em.
  helena. you are too young, too happy, and too good,
    to make yourself a son out of my blood.
  fourth lord. fair one, i think not so.
  lafeu. there's one grape yet; i am sure thy father drunk wine-but
    if thou be'st not an ass, i am a youth of fourteen; i have known
    thee already.
  helena.  [to bertram]  i dare not say i take you; but i give
    me and my service, ever whilst i live,
    into your guiding power. this is the man.
  king. why, then, young bertram, take her; she's thy wife.
  bertram. my wife, my liege! i shall beseech your highness,
    in such a business give me leave to use
    the help of mine own eyes.
  king. know'st thou not, bertram,
    what she has done for me?
  bertram. yes, my good lord;
    but never hope to know why i should marry her.
  king. thou know'st she has rais'd me from my sickly bed.
  bertram. but follows it, my lord, to bring me down
    must answer for your raising? i know her well:
    she had her breeding at my father's charge.
    a poor physician's daughter my wife! disdain
    rather corrupt me ever!
  king. 'tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which
    i can build up. strange is it that our bloods,
    of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,
    would quite confound distinction, yet stand off
    in differences so mighty. if she be
    all that is virtuous-save what thou dislik'st,
    a poor physician's daughter-thou dislik'st
    of virtue for the name; but do not so.
    from lowest place when virtuous things proceed,
    the place is dignified by the doer's deed;
    where great additions swell's, and virtue none,
    it is a dropsied honour. good alone
    is good without a name. vileness is so:
    the property by what it is should go,
    not by the title. she is young, wise, fair;
    in these to nature she's immediate heir;
    and these breed honour. that is honour's scorn
    which challenges itself as honour's born
    and is not like the sire. honours thrive
    when rather from our acts we them derive
    than our fore-goers. the mere word's a slave,
    debauch'd on every tomb, on every grave
    a lying trophy; and as oft is dumb
    where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb
    of honour'd bones indeed. what should be said?
    if thou canst like this creature as a maid,
    i can create the rest. virtue and she
    is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.
  bertram. i cannot love her, nor will strive to do 't.
  king. thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.
  helena. that you are well restor'd, my lord, i'm glad.
    let the rest go.
  king. my honour's at the stake; which to defeat,
    i must produce my power. here, take her hand,
    proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift,
    that dost in vile misprision shackle up
    my love and her desert; that canst not dream
    we, poising us in her defective scale,
    shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know
    it is in us to plant thine honour where
    we please to have it grow. check thy contempt;
    obey our will, which travails in thy good;
    believe not thy disdain, but presently
    do thine own fortunes that obedient right
    which both thy duty owes and our power claims;
    or i will throw thee from my care for ever
    into the staggers and the careless lapse
    of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate
    loosing upon thee in the name of justice,
    without all terms of pity. speak; thine answer.
  bertram. pardon, my gracious lord; for i submit
    my fancy to your eyes. when i consider
    what great creation and what dole of honour
    flies where you bid it, i find that she which late
    was in my nobler thoughts most base is now
    the praised of the king; who, so ennobled,
    is as 'twere born so.
  king. take her by the hand,
    and tell her she is thine; to whom i promise
    a counterpoise, if not to thy estate
    a balance more replete.
  bertram. i take her hand.
  king. good fortune and the favour of the king
    smile upon this contract; whose ceremony
    shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,
    and be perform'd to-night. the solemn feast
    shall more attend upon the coming space,
    expecting absent friends. as thou lov'st her,
    thy love's to me religious; else, does err.

    themselves upon thee.
  parolles. this is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.
  lafeu. go to, sir; you were beaten in italy for picking a kernel
    out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond, and no true traveller;
    you are more saucy with lords and honourable personages than the
    commission of your birth and virtue gives you heraldry. you are

  parolles. go to, thou art a witty fool; i have found thee.
  clown. did you find me in yourself, sir, or were you taught to find
    me? the search, sir, was profitable; and much fool may you find
    in you, even to the world's pleasure and the increase of
    laughter.
  parolles. a good knave, i' faith, and well fed.
    madam, my lord will go away to-night:
    a very serious business calls on him.
    the great prerogative and rite of love,
    which, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge;
    but puts it off to a compell'd restraint;
    whose want, and whose delay, is strew'd with sweets,
    which they distil now in the curbed time,
    to make the coming hour o'erflow with joy
    and pleasure drown the brim.
  helena. what's his else?
  parolles. that you will take your instant leave o' th' king,
    and make this haste as your own good proceeding,
    strength'ned with what apology you think
    may make it probable need.
  helena. what more commands he?
  parolles. that, having this obtain'd, you presently
    attend his further pleasure.
  helena. in everything i wait upon his will.
  parolles. i shall report it so.
  helena. i pray you.                              exit parolles
    come, sirrah.                                         exeunt

paris. the king's palace

enter lafeu and bertram

  lafeu. but i hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier.
  bertram. yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.
  lafeu. you have it from his own deliverance.
  bertram. and by other warranted testimony.
  lafeu. then my dial goes not true; i took this lark for a bunting.
  bertram. i do assure you, my lord, he is very great in knowledge,
    and accordingly valiant.
  lafeu. i have then sinn'd against his experience and transgress'd
    against his valour; and my state that way is dangerous, since i
    cannot yet find in my heart to repent. here he comes; i pray you
    make us friends; i will pursue the amity

                         enter parolles

  parolles.  [to bertram]  these things shall be done, sir.
  lafeu. pray you, sir, who's his tailor?
  parolles. sir!
  lafeu. o, i know him well. ay, sir; he, sir, 's a good workman, a
    very good tailor.
  bertram.  [aside to parolles]  is she gone to the king?
  parolles. she is.
  bertram. will she away to-night?
  parolles. as you'll have her.
  bertram. i have writ my letters, casketed my treasure,
    given order for our horses; and to-night,
    when i should take possession of the bride,
    end ere i do begin.
  lafeu. a good traveller is something at the latter end of a dinner;
    but one that lies three-thirds and uses a known truth to pass a
    thousand nothings with, should be once heard and thrice beaten.
    god save you, captain.
  bertram. is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur?
  parolles. i know not how i have deserved to run into my lord's
    displeasure.
  lafeu. you have made shift to run into 't, boots and spurs and all,
    like him that leapt into the custard; and out of it you'll run
    again, rather than suffer question for your residence.
  bertram. it may be you have mistaken him, my lord.
  lafeu. and shall do so ever, though i took him at's prayers.
    fare you well, my lord; and believe this of me: there can be no
    kernal in this light nut; the soul of this man is his clothes;
    trust him not in matter of heavy consequence; i have kept of them
    tame, and know their natures. farewell, monsieur; i have spoken
    better of you than you have or will to deserve at my hand; but we
    must do good against evil.                              exit
  parolles. an idle lord, i swear.
  bertram. i think so.
  parolles. why, do you not know him?
  bertram. yes, i do know him well; and common speech
    gives him a worthy pass. here comes my clog.

                          enter helena

  helena. i have, sir, as i was commanded from you,
    spoke with the king, and have procur'd his leave
    for present parting; only he desires
    some private speech with you.
  bertram. i shall obey his will.
    you must not marvel, helen, at my course,
    which holds not colour with the time, nor does
    the ministration and required office
    on my particular. prepar'd i was not
    for such a business; therefore am i found
    so much unsettled. this drives me to entreat you
    that presently you take your way for home,
    and rather muse than ask why i entreat you;
    for my respects are better than they seem,
    and my appointments have in them a need
    greater than shows itself at the first view
    to you that know them not. this to my mother.
                                               [giving a letter]
    'twill be two days ere i shall see you; so
    i leave you to your wisdom.
  helena. sir, i can nothing say
    but that i am your most obedient servant.
  bertram. come, come, no more of that.
  helena. and ever shall
    with true observance seek to eke out that
    wherein toward me my homely stars have fail'd
    to equal my great fortune.
  bertram. let that go.
    my haste is very great. farewell; hie home.
  helena. pray, sir, your pardon.
  bertram. well, what would you say?
  helena. i am not worthy of the wealth i owe,
    nor dare i say 'tis mine, and yet it is;
    but, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal
    what law does vouch mine own.
  bertram. what would you have?
  helena. something; and scarce so much; nothing, indeed.
    i would not tell you what i would, my lord.
    faith, yes:
    strangers and foes do sunder and not kiss.
  bertram. i pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse.
  helena. i shall not break your bidding, good my lord.
  bertram. where are my other men, monsieur?
    farewell!                                        exit helena
    go thou toward home, where i will never come
    whilst i can shake my sword or hear the drum.
    away, and for our flight.

act iii. scene 1.
florence. the duke's palace

        flourish. enter the duke of florence, attended; two
               french lords, with a troop of soldiers

  duke. so that, from point to point, now have you hear
    the fundamental reasons of this war;
    whose great decision hath much blood let forth
    and more thirsts after.
  first lord. holy seems the quarrel
    upon your grace's part; black and fearful
    on the opposer.
  duke. therefore we marvel much our cousin france
    would in so just a business shut his bosom
    against our borrowing prayers.
  second lord. good my lord,
    the reasons of our state i cannot yield,
    but like a common and an outward man
    that the great figure of a council frames
    by self-unable motion; therefore dare not
    say what i think of it, since i have found
    myself in my incertain grounds to fail
    as often as i guess'd.
  duke. be it his pleasure.
  first lord. but i am sure the younger of our nature,
    that surfeit on their ease, will day by day
    come here for physic.
  duke. welcome shall they be
    and all the honours that can fly from us
    shall on them settle. you know your places well;
    when better fall, for your avails they fell.
    to-morrow to th' field. flourish.                     exeunt




act iii. scene 2.
rousillon. the count's palace

enter countess and clown

  countess. it hath happen'd all as i would have had it, save that he
    comes not along with her.
  clown. by my troth, i take my young lord to be a very melancholy
    man.
  countess. by what observance, i pray you?
  clown. why, he will look upon his boot and sing; mend the ruff and
    sing; ask questions and sing; pick his teeth and sing. i know a
    man that had this trick of melancholy sold a goodly manor for a
    song.
  countess. let me see what he writes, and when he means to come.
                                              [opening a letter]
  clown. i have no mind to isbel since i was at court. our old ling
    and our isbels o' th' country are nothing like your old ling and
    your isbels o' th' court. the brains of my cupid's knock'd out;
    and i begin to love, as an old man loves money, with no stomach.
  countess. what have we here?
  clown. e'en that you have there.                          exit
  countess.  [reads]  'i have sent you a daughter-in-law; she hath
    recovered the king and undone me. i have wedded her, not bedded
    her; and sworn to make the "not" eternal. you shall hear i am run
    away; know it before the report come. if there be breadth enough
    in the world, i will hold a long distance. my duty to you.
                                           your unfortunate son,
                                                       bertram.'
    this is not well, rash and unbridled boy,
    to fly the favours of so good a king,
    to pluck his indignation on thy head
    by the misprizing of a maid too virtuous
    for the contempt of empire.

                           re-enter clown

  clown. o madam, yonder is heavy news within between two soldiers
    and my young lady.
  countess. what is the -matter?
  clown. nay, there is some comfort in the news, some comfort; your
    son will not be kill'd so soon as i thought he would.
  countess. why should he be kill'd?
  clown. so say i, madam, if he run away, as i hear he does the
    danger is in standing to 't; that's the loss of men, though it be
    the getting of children. here they come will tell you more. for my
    part, i only hear your son was run away.                exit

              enter helena and the two french gentlemen

  second gentleman. save you, good madam.
  helena. madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone.
  first gentleman. do not say so.
  countess. think upon patience. pray you, gentlemen-
    i have felt so many quirks of joy and grief
    that the first face of neither, on the start,
    can woman me unto 't. where is my son, i pray you?
  first gentleman. madam, he's gone to serve the duke of florence.
    we met him thitherward; for thence we came,
    and, after some dispatch in hand at court,
    thither we bend again.
  helena. look on this letter, madam; here's my passport.
    [reads]  'when thou canst get the ring upon my finger, which
    never shall come off, and show me a child begotten of thy body
    that i am father to, then call me husband; but in such a "then" i
    write a "never."
    this is a dreadful sentence.
  countess. brought you this letter, gentlemen?
  first gentleman. ay, madam;
    and for the contents' sake are sorry for our pains.
  countess. i prithee, lady, have a better cheer;
    if thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,
    thou robb'st me of a moiety. he was my son;
    but i do wash his name out of my blood,
    and thou art all my child. towards florence is he?
  first gentleman. ay, madam.
  countess. and to be a soldier?
  first gentleman. such is his noble purpose; and, believe 't,
    the duke will lay upon him all the honour
    that good convenience claims.
  countess. return you thither?
  second gentleman. ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.
  helena.  [reads]  'till i have no wife, i have nothing in france.'
    'tis bitter.
  countess. find you that there?
  helena. ay, madam.
  second gentleman. 'tis but the boldness of his hand haply, which
    his heart was not consenting to.
  countess. nothing in france until he have no wife!
    there's nothing here that is too good for him
    but only she; and she deserves a lord
    that twenty such rude boys might tend upon,
    and call her hourly mistress. who was with him?
  second gentleman. a servant only, and a gentleman
    which i have sometime known.
  countess. parolles, was it not?
  second gentleman. ay, my good lady, he.
  countess. a very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.
    my son corrupts a well-derived nature
    with his inducement.
  second gentleman. indeed, good lady,
    the fellow has a deal of that too much
    which holds him much to have.
  countess. y'are welcome, gentlemen.
    i will entreat you, when you see my son,
    to tell him that his sword can never win
    the honour that he loses. more i'll entreat you
    written to bear along.
  first gentleman. we serve you, madam,
    in that and all your worthiest affairs.
  countess. not so, but as we change our courtesies.
    will you draw near?            exeunt countess and gentlemen
  helena. 'till i have no wife, i have nothing in france.'
    nothing in france until he has no wife!
    thou shalt have none, rousillon, none in france
    then hast thou all again. poor lord! is't
    that chase thee from thy country, and expose
    those tender limbs of thine to the event
    of the non-sparing war? and is it i
    that drive thee from the sportive court, where thou
    wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark
    of smoky muskets? o you leaden messengers,
    that ride upon the violent speed of fire,
    fly with false aim; move the still-piecing air,
    that sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.
    whoever shoots at him, i set him there;
    whoever charges on his forward breast,
    i am the caitiff that do hold him to't;
    and though i kill him not, i am the cause
    his death was so effected. better 'twere
    i met the ravin lion when he roar'd
    with sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere
    that all the miseries which nature owes
    were mine at once. no; come thou home, rousillon,
    whence honour but of danger wins a scar,
    as oft it loses all. i will be gone.
    my being here it is that holds thee hence.
    shall i stay here to do 't? no, no, although
    the air of paradise did fan the house,
    and angels offic'd all. i will be gone,
    that pitiful rumour may report my flight
    to consolate thine ear. come, night; end, day.
    for with the dark, poor thief, i'll steal away.         exit




act iii. scene 3.
florence. before the duke's palace

flourish. enter the duke of florence, bertram, parolles, soldiers,
drum and trumpets

  duke. the general of our horse thou art; and we,
    great in our hope, lay our best love and credence
    upon thy promising fortune.
  bertram. sir, it is
    a charge too heavy for my strength; but yet
    we'll strive to bear it for your worthy sake
    to th' extreme edge of hazard.
  duke. then go thou forth;
    and fortune play upon thy prosperous helm,
    as thy auspicious mistress!
  bertram. this very day,
    great mars, i put myself into thy file;
    make me but like my thoughts, and i shall prove
    a lover of thy drum, hater of love.                   exeunt




act iii. scene 4.
rousillon. the count's palace

enter countess and steward

  countess. alas! and would you take the letter of her?
    might you not know she would do as she has done
    by sending me a letter? read it again.
  steward.  [reads]  'i am saint jaques' pilgrim, thither gone.
    ambitious love hath so in me offended
    that barefoot plod i the cold ground upon,
    with sainted vow my faults to have amended.
    write, write, that from the bloody course of war
    my dearest master, your dear son, may hie.
    bless him at home in peace, whilst i from far
    his name with zealous fervour sanctify.
    his taken labours bid him me forgive;
    i, his despiteful juno, sent him forth
    from courtly friends, with camping foes to live,
    where death and danger dogs the heels of worth.
    he is too good and fair for death and me;
    whom i myself embrace to set him free.'
  countess. ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words!
    rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much
    as letting her pass so; had i spoke with her,
    i could have well diverted her intents,
    which thus she hath prevented.
  steward. pardon me, madam;
    if i had given you this at over-night,
    she might have been o'er ta'en; and yet she writes
    pursuit would be but vain.
  countess. what angel shall
    bless this unworthy husband? he cannot thrive,
    unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear
    and loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath
    of greatest justice. write, write, rinaldo,
    to this unworthy husband of his wife;
    let every word weigh heavy of her worth
    that he does weigh too light. my greatest grief,
    though little he do feel it, set down sharply.
    dispatch the most convenient messenger.
    when haply he shall hear that she is gone
    he will return; and hope i may that she,
    hearing so much, will speed her foot again,
    led hither by pure love. which of them both
    is dearest to me i have no skill in sense
    to make distinction. provide this messenger.
    my heart is heavy, and mine age is weak;
    grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.     exeunt
