        "During my design science research class (DSR) with Professor Chatterjee, we explored the question, \"Can robots or AI have consciousness in the future?\" To address this topic, we read several articles on human consciousness. I found it challenging to grasp the concept of consciousness. Human consciousness drives our feelings and senses, which can lead to experiences of happiness or sadness. These emotions are not merely mental states; they also influence our physical state and how we perceive the external world.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, AI lacks this depth of experience because it is limited to the confines of computer chips. Additionally, AI cannot be classified as \"sentient\" since sentience involves the capacity to feel suffering, particularly as a result of empathy for others or regret over one's own decisions. One article emphasized the importance of understanding human consciousness more thoroughly before attempting to implement any of its aspects into robots or AI systems. Personally, I believe it is premature to conclude that advanced AI will acquire consciousness or become \"sentient\" in the near future.\n",

        "\"After reading How ChatGPT Kicked Off an A.I. Arms Race, I’m struck by how quickly generative A.I. tools have evolved—and how much hype surrounds them. Although ChatGPT can produce remarkably human-like text, it’s not “sentient” in the way we usually define consciousness; it’s essentially predicting what words should come next based on patterns in massive training data. That said, it can still transform many fields—education, content creation, and search engines—within just the next few years, because it automates tasks once reserved for human writers and coders. I think the biggest difference between ChatGPT’s “thinking” and human thinking is that ChatGPT has no personal experiences or emotions; it recombines existing information rather than genuinely experiencing or reflecting. Over the next two or three years, I expect ChatGPT (and successors like GPT-4) to push other tech giants and startups to integrate large language models everywhere, sparking both exciting innovations and serious debates about authenticity, regulation, and ethical use.\"\n",

        "In my experience, ChatGPT’s responses are often clear and coherent, but it can still produce factual errors or biased outputs. This underscores the idea that it’s not truly “reasoning” the way humans do, but it can imitate human reasoning in that it seems to have self-awareness."
