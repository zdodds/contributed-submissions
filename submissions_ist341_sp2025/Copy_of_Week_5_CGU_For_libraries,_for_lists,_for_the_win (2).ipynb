Quality assurance is a planned and systematic pattern of all actions necessary to provide confidencethat adequate technical requirements are established; products and services conform to established technicalrequirements; and satisfactory performance is achieved. For the Government, contract quality assurance is amethod to determine if a supplier of products or services fulfilled its contract obligations pertaining toproducts or services provided. It includes all actions required to ensure the Government is receiving theproper products and services.
