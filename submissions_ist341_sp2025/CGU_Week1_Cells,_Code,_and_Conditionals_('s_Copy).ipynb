Instead of saying \"pass the salt to left\", you have to do it from their point of view and say \"pass the salt to your right.\" The amount of clarification we need in our language is more than one would think. On the flipside, body language is also comical to think about, as I feel like I can signify that I need the salt to their right just by pointing and motioning that I would like it. However, that changes once again if there is a pepper shaker in close proximity to the salt and therefore you would have to clarify further. \"Closer to you or closer to me\" is another directional language signifier that is in relation to point-of-view.\n",
