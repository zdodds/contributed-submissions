This project has shown me how to apply our SQL and database knowledge to a real-world business application. The guidelines for the project were straightforward, but didn’t tell us what exactly to do step-by-step. Usually, class projects tell us exactly what we need to do, but for this project we really had to hone in on the tools we learned in class to guide us through the project. I learned how to create a database in a team setting. I also learned how important it is to have a solid foundation before actually creating our database using SQL. For example, it was extremely helpful writing out why we need the database (business understanding), important information needed in the database (data understanding), and a layout of what we want our database to look like (conceptual design). Having this written out makes the security requirements, logical design, physical design, and database implementation process more efficient as we went through our project. Overall, I really enjoyed the challenge of this project, and I feel that it definitely helps set me up for the business world.\n",

Its complex narrative structure, characterized by a web of alliances, rivalries, and collaborations, provides a unique opportunity to study network dynamics within a fictional framework. While it may initially appear as mere entertainment, the Marvel Universe functions as a dynamic social network where characters are the nodes, and their interactions form the edges. This intricate structure is not just a storytelling mechanism but also a reflection of real-world social systems. Analyzing this network enables researchers to uncover patterns of influence, hierarchy, and community, much like those observed in human societies.This study focuses on two pivotal research questions\"\"\"\n",
