# contributed-submissions
These are previous submissions, generously contributed to help create a foundation for the new Intro Computing courses under development

The goal of this project is to create a computing curriculum of value for every student in higher ed, responsive to today's technological resources. This is neither maximally ambitious: contrast with _every_ student, nor is it minimally ambitious: compare with only-CS students.

That said, it has been an animating purpose here at Harvey Mudd College for at least the past 30 years. My suspicion: It's even more important in 2026 than it was in 1996!
