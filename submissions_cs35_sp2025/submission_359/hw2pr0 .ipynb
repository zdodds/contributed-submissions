    "Prompt B) One of the \"Principles for Responsible Scraping\" that I particularly agreed with was 'I will scrape with the goal of creating value with your data, not simply duplicating it.' I feel like this is a principle that could potentially justify web scraping that is against outlined Terms of Service. Given that the data is publically available, it seems that blanket-statement bans of web scraping prevent potential positive services that could be generated through webscraping. I could imagine that  However, I understand that web scraping can also facilitate negative impacts on websites and users, so I understand why companies might include that sort of statement in their Terms of Service. One of the \"Principles of Ethical Scraping\" that I felt a bit more conflicted about was the one that suggested that scrapers make sure that they are clearly identified to website owners. Although this seems best in theory, I can imagine that this could result in additional roadblocks for scrapers who are trying to operate ethically, without affecting unethical scraping. "
