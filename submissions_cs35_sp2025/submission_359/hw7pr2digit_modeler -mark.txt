+ digits clasification -- and regression -- via NNets

Feel free to re-use your previous digits_cleaned.csv file 
### First, use the iris example to create a digit-predicting NNet

This is similar to the past two digits challenges, hw5 and hw6

**However**, because we're using NNets, you'll need to
+ create TEN categorical variables. You can use just one ``get_dummies`` pandas call
+ use a SCALER to make sure the network can, in a fair way, "hear" all of the inputs ### Second, from the iris example create a _pixel-predicting_ &nbsp; NNet

Choose a pixel to predict!
+ It _can_ be #42 -- or choose another one?!
+ This will be _regression_, not classification
+ It will show off NNets' ability to generate or "hallucinate" pixels/digits/images/etc.!
+ The _digit dreaming_ problem will extend this further...<b>Predict-a-pixel</b> (regression)...
+ As the penultimate part of this digits-analysis with NNets, 
+ create a regressor that predicts pixel 42 from the other 63 pixels!
+ Remember that pixel 42 will be `A[:,42]`
+ and, the other 63, plus the digit-species, will be `np.concatenate((A[:,0:42], A[:,43:]),axis=1)`
+ see the iris_modeler for an example for the irises' botanical features...
