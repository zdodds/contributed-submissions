Problem 0:   <i>LLMs as prose "meta-programming" </i>   (hw3pr0.ipynb)  

Today's article:

+ [here from the original source (the Economist, June 26, 2024)](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2024/06/26/at-least-10-of-research-may-already-be-co-authored-by-ai) 

<br>

Titled <u>At least 10% of research may already be co-authored by AI</u>, this Economist article reports on the extent LLMs are being used as "meta-programming" tools for research prose, comparing disciplines, languages, and - fun - particular words that LLMs seem to use disproportionally much. Take a look and then...

<br>

Consider the pros, cons, and evolving policies:
+ <b><font color="DodgerBlue">pros</font></b> &nbsp;&nbsp;   "They can breathe life into dense scientific prose and speed up the drafting process, especially for non-native English speakers."  <br><br>
+ <b><font color="DodgerBlue">cons</font></b> &nbsp;&nbsp;  "Scientific papers rely on the precise communication of uncertainty, where the capabilities of LLMs remain murky. Hallucinations -- whereby LLMs confidently assert fantasies -- remain common, as does a tendency to regurgitate other peopleâ€™s words, verbatim, [unchecked](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/not-gouda-nough-google-removes-ai-generated-cheese-error-from-super-bowl-ad/), and without attribution." <br><br>
+ <b><font color="DodgerBlue">policies</font></b> &nbsp;&nbsp;  "Some journals ban it outright. Others have changed their minds." 

<br>

From there, create a short reflection, drawing from your own experiences, on a personally interesting subset of these prompts:
+ **(a)** where you think norms for meta-programmed prose  will converge in the coming 2-3 years?   and/or 
+ **(b)** where you think norms for meta-programmed prose  should converge in the coming 2-3 years?  and/or
+ **(c)** whether or not you feel different when encountering human-vs-GPT written prose?     and/or
+ **(d)** what strategies you, personally, use to distinguish work by a human vs work by AI... ?

<br>

<b><font color="Coral">Extra!</font></b> &nbsp;&nbsp; You're encouraged to use as many of the GPT-popular words as possible in your response!  ðŸ™‚

As with each week's reading, responses should be carefully considered, but need not be very CS35_Participant_2 (~5 or so sentences is wonderful).  

<hr>#### Reading response

To distinguish work written by AI from work written by a human, I have thought about word choice, as this article talked about, but also tone. Especially in a college academic context, the tone of work written by AI is often much more formal that what a student might write for a casual assignment. Oddly enough, ChatGPT can often produce things with a slightly more positive tone than a human might, creating text that is suspiciously chipper! However, even with this in mind, I am sure that I have encountered LLM-authored text more than I would expect and didn't notice at all, so these may just be hallmarks of careless AI usage. Knowing that prose is written by ChatGPT does change my perspective on and experience of reading a passage: I can be rather reluctant to read ChatGPT authored work because I am afraid of internalizing and replicating LLM patterns in my own work
