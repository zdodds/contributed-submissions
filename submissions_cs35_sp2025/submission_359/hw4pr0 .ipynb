    "I thought this was an interesting reading and definitely agree with the author's proposed principles. However, one principle I believe is especially difficult to follow or enforce is the second, that AIs must disclose themselves as such. Lots of times, people use AI with the desire to allow them to complete tasks more quickly, and this personal disclosure is often something people are hesitant to make. In addition, lots of times disclosure is hindered by people wanting to 'take credit' themselves--kind of relating to the 'credit' discussion we had in an earlier reading, in terms of who actually deserves credit for AI work. In addition, related to what they were mentioning about AI weapons or an AI TA at Georgia Tech... I believe that at times, AI's effectiveness is diminished if its non-human identity is disclosed. An AI TA may provide as or more effective feedback than a human one, but I believe if people know it is such, its perceived helpfulness would decrease. The difficulty of trying to identify AI seems to me to make this principle one that will be impossible to be followed on a large scale as AI usage continues to grow. "
