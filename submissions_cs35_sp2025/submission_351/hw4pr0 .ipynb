    "I agree with almost all of the laws of that Etzioni proposed for AI. I think for the most important of all of them is the second rule. Etzioni says that bots, that use AI, have worked for good, for example Georgia Tech's Jill Watson bot teaching assistant or on social media platforms like @DeepDrumpf on X, an account that humorously impersonates Trump. However, I think AI bots have also been used for bad; for example, political, pro-Trump AI bots that posted numerous statements supporting the Republican party through the 2016 election. It's not only the fact that they were supporting Trump, but they were bots who simply were following the instructions of pro-Trump user, which is one of Asimov's laws. So, I question...even if the AI bots don't harm humans directly or risk their protection, isn't wrong to lead astray humans who think that others support their statements but aren't actually?"
