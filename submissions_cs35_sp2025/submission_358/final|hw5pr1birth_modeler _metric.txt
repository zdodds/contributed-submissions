# hw5pr1births_modeler:  birth classification model-building 
#
# the relationship:  using features month + day, how well can we predict "birth-popularity" 
#
#     to keep this as _classification_, we will use the binary above/below median as the target (the median is 190942)
#


#
# suggestion:  
# 
#       +++ copy-paste-and-alter from the iris-modeling notebook to here +++
#
# this approach has the advantage of more deeply "digesting" the iris workflow...
#      ...altering the parts that don't transfer, and taking the parts that do
#

#
# warning:    be _sure_ to remove the "births" column.    (it allows the modeling to "cheat"...)
#           


# you'll insert (or copy-paste-edit) lots of cells!
