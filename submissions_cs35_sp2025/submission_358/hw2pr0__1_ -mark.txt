<hr>#### Reading for hw2...     (hw2pr0.ipynb)


<br>
Problem 0:      <i><b>(When)  Is webscraping legal and/or ethical?     [10 pts]</b></i>

This week's reading includes 1++ short articles:
+ The first article  is entitled, [Is Web Scraping Ethical](https://scrapeops.io/web-scraping-playbook/ethics-of-web-scraping/) by ScrapeOps.io (they're not impartial: they're a webscraping-tools company!)

<br>

+ The "+" article is Meta's [Facebook Terms of Service](https://www.facebook.com/terms.php).  (Perhaps this should be the "+1" article?)
  + We're definitely _not_ asking you to read the whole Facebook/Meta ToS!  Rather, find your way to Section 3, Subsection 2 ***"What you can share and do on Meta."***   It's relatively short: it's one "screenful."
  + The one sub-sub-section to consider especially carefully is 3.2.3.

<br>

+ In addition, we share this _flowchart_ of webscraping, from [this article by Sophie Chou of the MIT Media Lab and Pro Publica](https://www.storybench.org/to-scrape-or-not-to-scrape-the-technical-and-ethical-challenges-of-collecting-data-off-the-web/) (you need not read the article - if you do open it, notice the first line of the <i>above-the-fold</i> Python script!)

Then, in response to these resources, reflect on any <u>one of these three prompts</u>:   
+ (**Prompt A**) Look over Sophie Chiu's "Should you scrape?" flowchart. Find one decision node that you particularly agree -- or disagree -- with and elaborate on why. (Feel free to note whether you feel this hw adheres to the chart!)  
+ (**Prompt B**) At the end of the first article there is a set of "Principles for Responsible Scraping" Looking that over, find one principle you particularly agree -- or disagree -- with and elaborate on why.  
+ (**Prompt C**) Having read some of Facebook's ToS, consider its stated requirement "You may not access or collect data from our Products using automated means..."  Elaborate on what you think "automated means" includes -- and doesn't include.   

<br>

As with each week's reading, responses should be carefully considered, but need not be very CS35_Participant_2 (~5 or so sentences is wonderful).

I found the "are you on dead line" very interesting becuase I am on a deadline now. I wonder if the deadline lead to ethical problems such as the use of the data without the permission due to the pressure of the dead line. Moreover, Sophie Chiu also did not give a solution to it, it was just a simple no. Thus, I wonder what else one may do to achieve web scraping while having a deadline.
