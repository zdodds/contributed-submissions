    "#### The Response\n",
    "(a) I believe in both sides of the credit blame asymmetry. I think this asymmetry comes from consideration of the wider context of LLM generated content, particularly as it pertains to impact scaling. The cases where LLM causes harm (widespread disinformation, IP theft, miseducation) often carry far more weight than when LLM contributes to good. \n",
    "\n",
    "(b) I think AI systems lean towards ethically detracting. All it really does is expedite processes that would otherwise be achievable, but take more time and effort to complete. In terms of harm, this means LLMs allow actions that harm to be completed much more easily, allowing harms to be propagated further and faster than before. As for actions that do good, it certainly may have benefits towards creating more \"good\" faster, like for example expediting novel research with large scale benefits, but making that process easier and removing the critical thinking behind the process seems like a fast pass to wider intellectual degeneration. It's disheartening to see peers be unable to write without LLM, among other necessary skills for making positive contribution to the world. This is my current standpoint, but it is definitely subject to change. I feel like people could've absolutely felt similarly to how I do towards AI at the advent of the internet, but as someone whose grown up with the internet it doesn't feel like I have less skills than the people who came before me, just that I'm allowed to do more with the expediting aid of the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "I do think rules should be established around AI systems. I wish I knew how best to establish these rules, and what rules to establish, but I do know that the growth of AI has led to a lot of harm in different avenues. One that I particularly am interested in is the use of AI in art. On one hand, AI has killed a lot of creative jobs (marketing, graphic design, etc.) and has been used to steal certain artist's styles to mass produce replicas of their work. On the other hand, AI creates a lot of interesting ideas about creation, what is visually possible, and it can aid artists in minor ways to allow them to be more prolific. How to limit AI to being purely a creative aid, and not a tool of replacement is a very tough problem though, and I'm not entirely sure how it would come about. I don't think there are any strict limitations developers can implement wihtin their programming without limiting the AI in ways that decrease its ability to be used in constructive ways. That leaves proper use of AI as an unenforceable matter of \"honor code\", which is easily bypassed by a bad actor. So I'm not sure...... Maybe someone smarter than me can figure this out.... Or someone who is getting paid to think about these issues all day...."
