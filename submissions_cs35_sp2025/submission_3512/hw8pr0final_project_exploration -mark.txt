## Final project preliminaries

<font color="Teal"><b>Exploring how much an idea "pushes back" - including its technologies, libraries, and online resources ...</b></font>

<br>

#### Here are the  [cs35 project guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DwoOJCy6GGECvzSOE4BDPVcEgVtvChglnz03-uxx7mA/edit)  with more details.

And here is the [Colab version](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kASM8K0vqu40S5xjBS-hXf-bIDcQPZtz#scrollTo=1gAMoA_KN5L0) of this notebook. If Colab works better for your project, wonderful!

#### **What you've tried**
+ What are the things you've tried <b><u>so far</u></b> - and how has it gone?  
  + This is the most important effort!  
  + <b>Note</b>: If you have _lots_ of ideas and can't decide... look for online guides or walkthroughs for several of them and see which are most promising (and interesting!)
  + include, here in the Python cells above/below, the explorations and/or experiments you've pursued
  + if you're using plain-python files or other notebook files, submit those, in addition or instead
    + <font size="-2">if you submit other files instead, include these reflections in the files you submit...</font>
  + include any other <i>small</i> data files/links/resources you've collected

<br>
<br>#### **Your Project Plan,** <font size="-1">as of this moment...</font>

+ <b><font color="DodgerBlue">Share</font></b> a paragraph or so on your project exploration so far -- and your summer of the idea/plan + its background
  + This is intentionally ***progress-first***
  + **Try things out** before dedicating too much to a single, specific path...
+ <b><font color="Coral">Share</font></b>: &nbsp; What resources/libraries/walkthroughs have you found?
+ <b><font color="Coral">Share</font></b>: &nbsp; What datasets are you using? <font size="-1">if applicable for your project</font>

<br>
<br>#### **Looking ahead**
+ Specifically, what task do you plan to try <b><u>next</u></b>?
+ More generally, how do you plan to go _beyond_ existing resources...
  + If it's not shared above, describe how you envision _personalizing_ and/or _individualizing_ your project...<br><br>

#### <b><font color="DodgerBlue">what do i want to do/why</font></b>
I wanted my project to relate to something else I'm doing, and since the biophysics course I'm enrolled in also has an open-ended final project, I thought I'd fuse the two projects to do something cool. My current idea is to use online databases to construct a NN which can take in protein sequence data and tell us what secondary structures are within the protein. 

This feels like a rather straightforward use of NNs, and there are datasets I've already found which contain the information I need (ProteinNet, in particular), so I'm currently exploring extensions to this project. Perhaps considering more features about the protein, and having it be able to generate sequences that fit a series of features would be more challenging and interesting? Or considering the tertiary structure as well to create an image from the sequence? That seems significantly more challenging though

<br><br>

PS. Came up with idea before I knew about AlphaFold!

ProteinNet Github: https://github.com/aqlaboratory/proteinnet

Info on how the secondary and tertiary structure data is represented: https://github.com/aqlaboratory/proteinnet/blob/master/docs/proteinnet_records.md
+ I think secondary data should be simple, as there is a 1 letter code for each structure (alpha helix, beta sheet, etc.)
+ tertiary data is trickier, but all of the positions of the amino acids are encoded as vectors. Perhaps displaying each dimension would be possible?#### <b>looking ahead </b>

I'll have to understand their data formatting, now that I've downloaded their files. After looking at the files themselves, I think it could be a real challenge to transfer that information into Python, at least formatting-wise. From there I can perhaps get more creative with data vis or creating protein visuals (ambitious), or otherwise thinking about how I can make this project more of my own.
