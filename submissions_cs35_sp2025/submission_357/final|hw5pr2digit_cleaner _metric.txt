# hw5pr2digits_cleaner:  digit-data cleaning...
#



#
# *** suggestion ***  
# 
# +++ copy-paste-and-alter from the iris- and/or births-cleaning notebooks into here +++
#
# when the data is ready to view, you might want to grab
# the digits-visualization code (it's in the gdoc hw page)
#
# libraries!
import numpy as np      # numpy is python's "array" library
import pandas as pd     # pandas is python's "data" library ("dataframe" == spreadsheet)


#
# *** suggestion ***  
# 
#       +++ copy-paste-and-alter from the iris-cleaning notebook to here +++
#
# this approach has the advantage of more deeply "digesting" the iris workflow...
#      ... altering the parts that don't transfer, and taking the parts that do!
#

# eventually you'll get rid of the _births_ column, that can be here or in the modeling notebook
# read in our spreadsheet (csv)
# read in the spreadsheet (csv)

filename = 'digits.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(filename)  # adjust encoding if necessary
print(f"{filename} : file read into a pandas dataframe.")

# define row and column for clarity
row = 0        
column = 1     

# drop the final column if it exists (adjust column name if different)
unwanted_column = 'excerpted from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/'
if unwanted_column in df.columns:
    df_clean1 = df.drop(unwanted_column, axis=column)

# drop all rows with missing data (nan values)
df_clean2 = df_clean1.dropna()

# make a copy before adding new columns

# drop the 'actual_digit' column as it will be used as labels in modeling

df_tidy = df_clean3

# construct the new filename
cleaned_filename = filename.replace('.csv', '_cleaned.csv')
