<hr>#### Reading for hw2...     (hw2pr0.ipynb)


<br>
Problem 0:      <i><b>(When)  Is webscraping legal and/or ethical?     [10 pts]</b></i>

This week's reading includes 1++ short articles:
+ The first article  is entitled, [Is Web Scraping Ethical](https://scrapeops.io/web-scraping-playbook/ethics-of-web-scraping/) by ScrapeOps.io (they're not impartial: they're a webscraping-tools company!)

<br>

+ The "+" article is Meta's [Facebook Terms of Service](https://www.facebook.com/terms.php).  (Perhaps this should be the "+1" article?)
  + We're definitely _not_ asking you to read the whole Facebook/Meta ToS!  Rather, find your way to Section 3, Subsection 2 ***"What you can share and do on Meta."***   It's relatively short: it's one "screenful." 
  + The one sub-sub-section to consider especially carefully is 3.2.3.

<br>

+ In addition, we share this _flowchart_ of webscraping, from [this article by Sophie Chou of the MIT Media Lab and Pro Publica](https://www.storybench.org/to-scrape-or-not-to-scrape-the-technical-and-ethical-challenges-of-collecting-data-off-the-web/) (you need not read the article - if you do open it, notice the first line of the <i>above-the-fold</i> Python script!)

<br>
Then, in response to these resources, reflect on any <u>one of these three prompts</u>:   
+ (**Prompt A**) Look over Sophie Chiu's "Should you scrape?" flowchart. Find one decision node that you particularly agree -- or disagree -- with and elaborate on why. (Feel free to note whether you feel this hw adheres to the chart!)  
+ (**Prompt B**) At the end of the first article there is a set of "Principles for Responsible Scraping" Looking that over, find one principle you particularly agree -- or disagree -- with and elaborate on why.  
+ (**Prompt C**) Having read some of Facebook's ToS, consider its stated requirement "You may not access or collect data from our Products using automated means..."  Elaborate on what you think "automated means" includes -- and doesn't include.   

<br>

As with each week's reading, responses should be carefully considered, but need not be very CS35_Participant_2 (~5 or so sentences is wonderful).  

<hr>#### Reading response

(Feel free to use this cell for your response.)<b>Answering Prompt C</b>

<p>When I think about "automated means" in Facebook’s Terms of Service, I believe it includes things like bots, web scrapers, and scripts that collect or interact with data without permission. This could mean using a program to automatically like posts, mass-message people, or scrape user information from profiles. It also probably includes tools that try to bypass security measures, like CAPTCHA tests, or anything designed to get around restrictions Facebook has in place.

However, I don’t think "automated means" includes things like built-in browser features, accessibility tools, or Facebook’s own approved integrations, like their API for developers. It also probably doesn’t apply to search engines indexing public posts, as CS35_Participant_2 as they follow the rules. If someone uses a simple browser extension to save posts for later or organize their own data, I don’t think that would count as breaking the rules—unless it somehow messed with how Facebook runs or violated other users' privacy.</p>
