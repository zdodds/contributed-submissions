Problem 0:   <i>LLMs as prose "meta-programming" </i>   (hw3pr0.ipynb)  

Today's article:

Titled <u>At least 10% of research may already be co-authored by AI</u>, this Economist article reports on the extent LLMs are being used as "meta-programming" tools for research prose, comparing disciplines, languages, and - fun - particular words that LLMs seem to use disproportionally much. Take a look and then...

<br>

Consider the pros, cons, and evolving policies:
+ <b><font color="DodgerBlue">pros</font></b> &nbsp;&nbsp;   "They can breathe life into dense scientific prose and speed up the drafting process, especially for non-native English speakers."  <br><br>
+ <b><font color="DodgerBlue">cons</font></b> &nbsp;&nbsp;  "Scientific papers rely on the precise communication of uncertainty, where the capabilities of LLMs remain murky. Hallucinations -- whereby LLMs confidently assert fantasies -- remain common, as does a tendency to regurgitate other people’s words, verbatim, [unchecked](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/not-gouda-nough-google-removes-ai-generated-cheese-error-from-super-bowl-ad/), and without attribution." <br><br>
+ <b><font color="DodgerBlue">policies</font></b> &nbsp;&nbsp;  "Some journals ban it outright. Others have changed their minds." 

<br>

From there, create a short reflection, drawing from your own experiences, on a personally interesting subset of these prompts:
+ **(a)** where you think norms for meta-programmed prose  will converge in the coming 2-3 years?   and/or 
+ **(b)** where you think norms for meta-programmed prose  should converge in the coming 2-3 years?  and/or
+ **(c)** whether or not you feel different when encountering human-vs-GPT written prose?     and/or
+ **(d)** what strategies you, personally, use to distinguish work by a human vs work by AI... ?

As with each week's reading, responses should be carefully considered, but need not be very CS35_Participant_2 (~5 or so sentences is wonderful).

Answering (c): 

AI tools like large language models (LLMs) are becoming a big part of research writing, with some studies suggesting that at least 10% of papers already have AI co-authors​. One major advantage is that AI can help simplify complex scientific ideas and make the writing process faster, which is especially useful for researchers who aren't native English speakers. However, a big downside is that AI sometimes makes things up or copies text without proper citations, which can be risky in scientific work. Different journals have mixed policies—some completely ban AI assistance, while others are starting to accept it. Personally, I think AI-generated writing feels less natural, but it can be a useful tool if used carefully and ethically. However, with the evoloving technology, it is hard to distinguish written work by human and AI unless I am told that the work is written by one. Additionally, to answer briefly regarding quesiton D, I correlate advanced vocabularies not used in daily conversations and sentences with lots of commas with AI-generated work as they tend to lack sentence variety.
