##   hw6pr2digits_modeler 
+ digits clasification via decision trees and random forests...
+ Remember: feel free to re-use the cleaned data from previous weeks (already here)
## Data set up...
+ Use the cleaned data from prior weeks (it should be here in this folder as digits_cleaned.csv)
+ (I don't think there's too much more to adjust, data-wise...)
+ Next, let's see how well the DT/RF techniques can predict the digit, based on its 64 pixels...## First: &nbsp; _Decision Trees_## Then: &nbsp; _Random Forests_<br>

### Final task: &nbsp; _Visualizing_ pixel-importance:
+ using your best Random Forest model, find the 64 _relative feature importances_ for all 64 of the digits' pixels!
  + Show these as a list of 64 values (they will be difficult to imagine, but you will see that they vary a great deal, pixel-to-pixel)
+ Then, grab-and-adapt the code for visualizing individual digits in order to visualize the "importance image" of pixels...
+ that is, you'll create a heat map visualization, which is really just another image, of how relatively-important each of the 64 pixels is in your final Random Forest

This visualization will be a "low-res image" similar to the digits, ***but it won't itself be a digit*** 
+ Instead, it will show _how much_ each of the 64 spots, across all of the 8x8 grids in the dataset, contribute in classifying each digit...
