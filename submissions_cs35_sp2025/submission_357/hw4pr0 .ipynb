        "I strongly agree with the principle that AI must clearly disclose that it is not human. As AI systems become more advanced, they can mimic human speech and behavior so well that people might not realize they’re interacting with a machine. This can be a big problem, especially in areas like customer service, social media, and even education. For example, some students were tricked into thinking an AI teaching assistant was a real person, and political bots have been used to spread misinformation before elections. If AI doesn’t identify itself, it could be used to manipulate opinions, scam people, or create fake news. Transparency is important because it allows people to make informed decisions about whether to trust or engage with AI. While AI can be incredibly useful, it should never deceive us into thinking it’s something it’s not."
