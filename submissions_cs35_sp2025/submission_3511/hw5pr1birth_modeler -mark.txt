Suggestion:
+ set up this file and the example iris_modeler file side-by-side...
+ for each iris_modeler cell, copy it over..
   + edit it and make adjustments to suit the births problem (as needed)
   + run it to make sure it all works!

And, by the end, you'll have experienced the full ML/data modeling workflow (for classification, at least)
+ Running through this workflow by hand is a great way to digest the process...
+ hw5pr2 will ask you to do this again, with the digits
+ hw5ec is for another - optional - example, using your own dataset or, possibly, regression 

### <font color="Coral">Final, _big-picture_ question</font>   
+ Which phenomenon, iris-species or birthday-popularity, is more "modelable"?
+ ... at least, as far as these two datasets are concerned?!

Note that you might want to wait until _after_ modeling the births data to answer this...

<hr>

Below ... after finishing the model-building ... share your thoughts on which (irises/births) is more "modelable" and why ...

<br><br>## Modeling birthdays

Remember: Be sure to **drop** the column with the official birth numbers.

The goal is to model whether a birthday is above-average or below-average in popularity, based on two features: <tt>month</tt> and <tt>day</tt>### Congrats!

You've created a birthday-popularity modeler!

The rest of the hw - and the rest of our ML module - is to run more ML workflows:   
+ for different datasets:  &nbsp; (2) Digits, (ec) your own data, or Titanic, or Housing, or ...
+ and, starting next time, for different algorithms: &nbsp; decision trees and random forests, then nnets, ...

### Remember to answer the "which dataset is more modelable?" question: _births_ or _irises_ ?  

It's here:<br>

Here, share your thoughts on which (irises/births) is more "modelable" and why:

<br><br>
<br><br>iris has accuracy of 27/29 =93%

birthday has accuracy of 61/74 = 82%

seems like iris is more accurate

Theoretically, iris should be more modelable because the input is continuous and the output is categorical

Birthday is just a tad behind because the input is also categorical
