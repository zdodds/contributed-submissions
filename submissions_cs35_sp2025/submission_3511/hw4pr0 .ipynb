    "In response to the second statement that AI must disclose themselves. I think there are exceptions where an AI should not disclose themselves as such, for example, for a computer science research project.\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems like many (such as my physics teacher) have noticed that a notable feature of AI writing is their bland style. As such, I am sure one day researchers will want to ask the question of \"can an AI develop its own writing style?\" To test this theory out, researchers may need a do an advanced Turing test with a version of AI that won't share its identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "My ultimate concern is not whether or not AI will reach this stage, nor about the negative consequences after reaching this stage. My biggest concern is with the strictness of the principle. Since there exist exceptions, it means that these rules are not absolute. Hence, when should we follow these rules? When can we claim there is a \"greater good\" on the line so that these rules can be ignored? Perhaps we should view them as ideas or guidelines to keep in mind?\n",

    "We have the chance to create inteligence, and it is only reasonable that our AIs' morality closely follow its creator's moral code, not the moral code of this NYT author. Nevertheless! I see the good intentions behind these guidelines, but I just think executing them will be dificult and ambiguous at times.\n",
