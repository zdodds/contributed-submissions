### <font color="DodgerBlue">hw5pr2 digits cleaner</font>

Suggestions:
+ set up this file and the example iris_cleaner (or your births_cleaner) file side-by-side...
+ for each cell, copy it over...
   + edit it and make adjustments to suit the births problem (as needed)
   + run it to make sure it works... and you obtain your cleaned digits data.

Hints:
+ This data set is almost completely clean -- ***tidy*** in data-science parlance
+ So, the goal of this is building familiarity.
+ That is, no new tricks or situations are added here...
