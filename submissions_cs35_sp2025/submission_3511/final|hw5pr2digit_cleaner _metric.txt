# we can drop a series of data (a row or a column)
# the dimensions each have a numeric value, row~0, col~1, but let's use readable names we define:
row = 0
column = 1

# we are dropping this final column - it was just a citation...
df_clean1 = digits_orig.drop('excerpted from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/', axis=column)
df_clean1

# df_clean1 is a new dataframe, without that unwanted column


# no rows needed to be dropped
# and, let's drop the unwanted rows:
row = 0
column = 1

# df_clean2 = df_clean1.drop([142,143,144], axis=row)
df_clean2 = df_clean1


#
# let's drop _all_ rows with data that is missing/nan (not-a-number)
df_clean3 = df_clean2.dropna()  # drop na rows (nan, not-a-number)
df_clean3.info()  # print the info, and
# let's see the whole table, as well:
df_clean3

# tidy!  our data is ready!


#
# let's keep our column names in variables, for reference
#
columns = df_clean3.columns            # "list" of columns
print(f"columns is {columns}")
  # it's a "pandas" list, called an index
  # use it just as a python list of strings:
print(f"columns[0] is {columns[0]}\n")

# let's create a dictionary to look up an index from its name:
col_index = {}
for i, name in enumerate(columns):
    col_index[name] = i  # using the name (as key), look up the value (i)
print(f"col_index is {col_index}")
# print(f"col_index[ 'petallen' ] is {col_index[ 'petallen' ]}")


number_index = ['0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9']

# let's try it out...
for number in number_index:
    print(f"{number} maps to {number}")


# no need


# we can "apply" to a whole column and create a new column
#   it may give a warning, but this is ok...
#

df_clean4 = df_clean3.copy()  # copy everything and...

# # add a new column, 'irisnum'
# df_clean4['irisnum'] = df_clean3['irisname'].apply(convert_species)

# let's see...
df_clean4


#
# it's no fun fiddling with the default table formatting.
#
# remember: we have the data itself!  if we want to see it, we can print:

(nrows, ncols) = df_clean4.shape
print(f"there are {nrows = } and {ncols = }")
print()

for row in range(0,nrows,5):
    print(df_clean4[row:row+5])    # let's print 5 at a time...


df_tidy =  df_clean4


#
# that's it!  then, and write it out to iris_cleaned.csv
filename = 'digits.cvs'
# we'll construct the new filename:
old_filename_without_extension = filename[:-4]                      # remove the ".csv"

cleaned_filename = old_filename_without_extension + "_cleaned.csv"  # name-creating
print(f"cleaned_filename is {cleaned_filename}")

# now, save the dataframe names df_tidy
df_tidy.to_csv(cleaned_filename, index_label=false)  # no "index" column...


#
# let's make sure this worked, by re-reading in the data...
#

# let's re-read that file and take a look...
df_tidy_reread = pd.read_csv(cleaned_filename)   # encoding="utf-8" et al.
print(f"{cleaned_filename} : file read into a pandas dataframe.")
df_tidy_reread


#
# let's make sure we have all of our helpful variables in one place
#
#   since we changed the columns, this will have changed from above!
#

#
# let's keep our column names (features) in variables, for reference
#
columns = df_tidy_reread.columns            # "list" of columns
print(f"columns is {columns}\n")
  # it's a "pandas" list, called an index
  # use it just as a python list of strings:
print(f"columns[0] is {columns[0]}\n")

# let's create a dictionary to look up any column index by name
col_index = {}
for i, name in enumerate(columns):
    col_index[name] = i  # using the name (as key), look up the value (i)
print(f"col_index is {col_index}\n\n")


#
# and our "species" names - these aren't columns, nor rows. they're the target classifications!
#

# all of scikit-learn's ml routines need numbers, not strings
#   ... even for categories/classifications (like species!)
#   so, we will convert the flower-species to numbers:

number_index = ['0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9']

# let's try it out...
for number in number_index:
    print(f"{number} maps to {number}")
