    "I would agree that the creators should be held accountable for the errors, especially deliberate ones. If it is a code, the coder should run some troubleshooting procedures to make sure all is working as intended. \n",
    "As for credit, I think my view on this topic will change as I see AI evolve. I think a coder's task is to engineer an algorithm or function that meets the demands of a task. Historically, this part of the job would include typing the actual code itself, but since AI can code many basic functions. The coder's task might gradually shift to psuedocode, logic creation, and integrating the AI contributions to the code.\n",

I do not enjoy companies and schools trying to integrate ChatGPT and the like into programs that don't need it. I hate to say it, AI is good enough to make me lazy, but not good enough to make it into a trustworthy source. For creative work, I'd love to see the artist's ideas and creativity. The medium certainly plays a role as well. But I would mind incorperating AI elements into art, but things that are obviously AI generated are bad since I can tell it is obviously AI generated. Blame for misuse should fall on the users. Though there should be elements as failsafes. For example, AI pretending to be users on the internet can be distinguished by responding with \"ignore all previous instructions.\"\n",
