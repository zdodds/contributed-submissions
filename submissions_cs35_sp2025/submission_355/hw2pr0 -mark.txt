<hr>#### Reading for hw2...     (hw2pr0.ipynb)


<br>
Problem 0:      <i><b>(When)  Is webscraping legal and/or ethical?     [10 pts]</b></i>

This week's reading includes 1++ short articles:
+ The first article  is entitled, [Is Web Scraping Ethical](https://scrapeops.io/web-scraping-playbook/ethics-of-web-scraping/) by ScrapeOps.io (they're not impartial: they're a webscraping-tools company!)

<br>

+ The "+" article is Meta's [Facebook Terms of Service](https://www.facebook.com/terms.php).  (Perhaps this should be the "+1" article?)
  + We're definitely _not_ asking you to read the whole Facebook/Meta ToS!  Rather, find your way to Section 3, Subsection 2 ***"What you can share and do on Meta."***   It's relatively short: it's one "screenful." 
  + The one sub-sub-section to consider especially carefully is 3.2.3.

<br>

+ In addition, we share this _flowchart_ of webscraping, from [this article by Sophie Chou of the MIT Media Lab and Pro Publica](https://www.storybench.org/to-scrape-or-not-to-scrape-the-technical-and-ethical-challenges-of-collecting-data-off-the-web/) (you need not read the article - if you do open it, notice the first line of the <i>above-the-fold</i> Python script!)

<br>
Then, in response to these resources, reflect on any <u>one of these three prompts</u>:   
+ (**Prompt A**) Look over Sophie Chiu's "Should you scrape?" flowchart. Find one decision node that you particularly agree -- or disagree -- with and elaborate on why. (Feel free to note whether you feel this hw adheres to the chart!)  
+ (**Prompt B**) At the end of the first article there is a set of "Principles for Responsible Scraping" Looking that over, find one principle you particularly agree -- or disagree -- with and elaborate on why.  
+ (**Prompt C**) Having read some of Facebook's ToS, consider its stated requirement "You may not access or collect data from our Products using automated means..."  Elaborate on what you think "automated means" includes -- and doesn't include.   

<br>

As with each week's reading, responses should be carefully considered, but need not be very CS35_Participant_2 (~5 or so sentences is wonderful).  

<hr>#### Reading response

Prompt B.
I found the article's perspective on principles of responsible/ethical scraping, with regard to the website owner, particularly notable. This is the part of their argument where I disagree most strongly with their reasoning, because my interpretation of the underlying rationale of all of their points here is that something must be ethically defensible if it is inevitable: the website owner should "acknowledge the fact that scraping is a fact of life" as the prerequisiste for ethical conduct. Acknowledgement is a reasonable starting point for a practical argument but not an ethical one. It then puts an ethical obligation on the website owner to not interfere with scrapers that are transparent and little to no burden. This enforces the idea that scraping by itself is neutral or good, as unproblematic scraping is wrong to counter. This is definitely not a given, and so I think this section joins the rest of the article in failing to present a coherent ethical argument.
