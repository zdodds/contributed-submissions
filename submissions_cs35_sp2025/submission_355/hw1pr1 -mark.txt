## hw1pr1: <i>Files!</i>
+ walking through folders and files  (500 files - or many more!)
+ analyzing, counting, inquiring, and <i>insight-producing</i> as we go!  By the way, when I run the above cell on my desktop machine (Mac), the response is

``'/Users/zacharydodds/Desktop/cs35/week1/starting_notebooks'``

on a Windows laptop, the path uses a different separator. Mine is

``'c:\\Users\\dodds\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\cs35\\week1\\starting_notebooks'``

Your results will almost certainly differ.

In fact, if they *don't* differ ... I'm _very_ interested! ðŸ¤” ðŸ¦”In 2024, my Mac setup succeeds with a ``UserWarning`` that tells me to install the ``pickleshare`` library.

I refuse based on snack-sharing principles!

One can only share freely, not under admonishment/warning!

(If this happens to you - let me know and we'll fix it...)On first glance, it seems we can't open the file ``nottrue.ipynb`` ...

It's in the folder ``intro_first`` -- see if you can open it ...We *could* use the command-line ``cat`` or ``type`` one file at a time ...

But, what if we have to walk _500 files_ ?!  <font size="-2">(Alas, this joke stays around for at least this whole week!)</font>

  + Then, we need a function - and script - to access its contents. 
  + We started this last week, let's revisit it again here:Notice that, in Python, the Mac/forwardslash/style paths work, _even on Windows_#### But, we have 500 files...

Let's write <font color="DodgerBlue">_steppingstone_ functions</font> to make sense of our 500 files...

Let's start by reminding ourselves we can write a function that returns.

We'll call this Version 0:<hr>#### Introducing ``os.walk``

The function ``os.walk(path)`` will walk _any number_ of files...

Before we write a function, let's try  ``os.walk`` immediately:Here's a line-wrapped version of the list ``L``
  + Below it, is a picture of the folder-and-file structure!  
  + Our goal: mind-mapping the two representations!!``L = [('./intro_first', ['cs', 'sci'], ['.DS_Store', 'nottrue.ipynb']), 
('./intro_first/cs', [], ['.DS_Store', 'file35.txt', 'file181y.txt']), 
('./intro_first/sci', ['50', '10'], ['.DS_Store']), ('./intro_first/sci/50', [], ['IDE.txt']), ('./intro_first/sci/10', [], ['IDE.txt'])]``See if you can match the _syntactic_ structure (the text!) with the _visual_ structure (the image!) 

<hr>

Onward!#### Now, let's incorporate ``os.walk`` into a series of functions...Ok!  But we didn't actually "walk" the folders -- or files! 

That is, we only counted, and didn't <u>consider</u>, each one...

Let's print all of the folder names!
If you're on Windows, you likely see some "hidden MACOSX" directories, ``__MACOSX``

<font color="DodgerBlue"><b>Task!</b></font> 

Change the above code so that it _skips_ any path that contains the string ``__MACOSX``

We'll do this together...<hr>But, we want to see the files!

Let's print all their full filenames (the full paths)!**Aside**: &nbsp;&nbsp; It's possible to assemble paths using the operating system's "correct" character:Notice that it _joined_ the path and the file.

<br>

Since Python is happy with ``/`` we'll use that for now.

<hr>#### But, we want to get all of the files' _contents_  !

<u>Notice</u> there are lots of files named ``".DS_Store"`` ...

They are binary data used by MacOS - they will cause trouble!

Let's see the trouble, and then fix it:#### The encoding was wrong!  

(Those ``.DS_store`` files are binary, not human-readable.)

We could change to, say, latin-1 and see the bytes. But, let's not...

We really just want to _algorithmically_ skip over those files. Let's try it:

<font color="DodgerBlue"><b>Task to try</b></font>

Add an if statement in the above "steppingstone function" in order to simply skip over any file that begins with a dot (a period character: ``"."``)

Then, run it again. (It's ok to leave those dot files' pathnames - or not...)<hr>####  Two examples leading into our 10,000-file challenges! 

<u>Example 1</u> &nbsp; Let's count how many ``.txt`` files we have... <font color="DodgerBlue"><b>This is an example</b></font> of a short (1-3 sentence) markdown cell, giving interpretation and context for the above result...

#### Number of ``.txt`` files
  + It seems that this folder, ``intro_first`` has four (4) ``.txt`` files.  This seems reasonable!
  + We could go further and see what _percentage_ of files are ``.txt`` ... 
  + It's also worth noting that we're trusting the file extension ``.txt`` here: some text files could be masquerading as other things... ðŸ˜Š?!The key idea is to ...
  + share the results found, contextualized for us sapiens ...
  + consider what else could be done, even if we're not doing so ...
  + note possible incompletenesses, countervailing forces, concerns in general ...
  + use emojis ðŸ¦” !<hr>####  Second example: using file *contents* 

<u>Example 2</u> &nbsp; Let's count how many of the ``.txt`` files contain the substring ``'CS'`` -- not in the filename, but in the file ***contents***<font color="Coral"><b>Results:</b></font> 

#### Number of ``CS``-content ``.txt`` files
  + It seems that this folder, ``intro_first`` has two ``'CS'``-containing ``.txt`` files, out of four total ``.txt`` files, that is, ``50%`` <br><br>
  + <u>Reflection</u>: _This seems computationally balanced._ <br><br>
  + <u>Opportunities</u>: We could go further and try this in larger folders - such as this whole machine! Or, we could look for other things (like phone numbers or names in various formats). Or, really, we could ask-and-answer almost any algorithmic question about any subset of files on any machine at all... <br><br>
  +   _The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing._ - [Archilochus](https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/7614908.Archilochus#:~:text=Archilochus%20Quotes&text=We%20don't%20rise%20to,the%20level%20of%20our%20training.&text=The%20fox%20knows%20many%20things,hedgehog%20knows%20one%20big%20thing.&text=Heart%2C%20my%20heart%2C%20so%20battered,the%20men%20who%20hate%20us.) ðŸ¦” #### Trying other directories/folders

The ``path`` can be _any_ folder on your local machine, allowing for _arbitrary_ local exploration and discovery...

For example, this next cell will count <font color="Coral"><b>how many folders</b></font> do I have, starting at some ``path``
+ to count <font color="Coral"><b>files</b></font>, you'll need to build from the examples above#### <font color="DodgerBlue"><b>Your task</b></font>: The Rolodex challenge!
+ Here is [the homework page that describes hw1's challenges...](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SXgPlR00aIxahDi3OYR8y9-AODNwBuLbQsLLt9AKSa4/edit)
+ A few questions are "our" design
+ Then, ask-and-answer more are of _your_ design
+ And, you'll answer _your_ questions from at least two other "root" directories (the ``path`` that gets everything started is sometimes called the "root": the folder whose files your functions _walk_! :)
+ Create a short <font color="Coral"><b>Results:</b></font> section after each of "our" and _your_ questions. Feel free to use the template above.
+ Good luck, walking <i>far more</i> than one thousand files!

Results

Three Questions:
+ 1. Are there more NE or SW phone numbers across the whole dataset (meaning, area codes beginning with "2" or "9" respectively)?
+ 2. What is the earliest name alphabetically?
+ 3. What is the lowest and highest number of letters in someone's name?

Answers:
+ The minimum letter count in a name is 2 for Ri, the maximum count is 15 for Ananthakrishnan.
+ There are 764 NE area codes and 1087 SW area codes, so there are more SW area codes.
+ The alphabetically earliest name is Abdul.

Results are printed beneath block 49.
Reflection

Questions:
+ 1. What is the most common file type I have and how many of this file type are there?
+ 2. What is the largest file size here?
+ 3. Are there any duplicate file names and if so how many?

Answers:
+ Most common file types: [('', 133), ('.sample', 104), ('.ino', 73)] -- most relevant answer here is the .ino (Arduino) files
+ Largest file size: 6152372 bytes
+ Number of duplicate file names: 320, with most duplicated file name: "HEAD", in addition to a lot of files called "main"


(used Copilot for help writing and debugging. in this context it worked really well, especially when asked to modify what I already had rather than to write it from scratch)
