### Jupyter Notebooks and Markdown!
+ At heart, cs35 is about bridge-building between human expression and executable expression
+ markdown is a popular language for human expression  (this cell is markdown)
  + control-enter renders the Markdown  ("runs" it)
+ python is a popular language for executable expression (see cells below!)#### This is a Markdown cell, a <i>fourth-level</i> header
+ If you've already used Markdown, e.g., in Discord, wiki editing, etc., wonderful!
+ If you haven't used it, [this Markdown link](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) is a reference...
+ Equally or more welcome: &nbsp; Dive in! &nbsp; Share! &nbsp; Ask!#### <font color="Coral">First task</font> -- is "to markdown":
+ Here, use your markdown knowledge or research to...
+ **bold** this item
+ *italicize* this item
+ ~~strikethrough~~ this item
+ use ```fixed-width formatting``` for this item, i.e., code-style
+ and ***then do something else*** (your choice) with this item
+ BUT... <i><b><u>don't</u></b></i> use mark<u>up</u>, as this item does. Use mark<u>down</u>!
+ That is to say, don't use tags like <tt>\<i\>this\</i\></tt> for any of the challenges above...#### <font color="Coral">Second task</font> 

CS35_Participant_12
+ I have a twin sister! 
+ I'd highly recommend' [Derry Girls](https://www.netflix.com/search?q=derry&jbv=80238565) if you're looking to casually bingewatch a show with friends. 
+ I love learning about all the new tools we're building in the context of aerospace and biomedical engineering, a few years ago I got to [shadow](https://magazine.hmc.edu/summer-2021/my-year-before-mudd/) a trial of new less invasive surgical instruments and interview the test users for their feedback! 
+ I think real (and fictional) languages are super cool and would encourage anyone with 15-ish minutes to check out one of the many [languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindarin#:~:text=Sindarin%20is%20the%20language%20usually,greatly%20in%20grammar%20and%20structure.) that Tolkien came up with!#### <font color="Coral">Third task</font> include a linked image via url: this is some context as to where that one language fits in...

cs5 in one day!#### Let's use f-strings more carefully ...
#### Notice that variables persist from cell to cell...

Here, ``L`` and ``colleges`` are variables defined above.
Their values are still present:
#### ``split`` is a _really_ useful function

Notice that it is called <i>by</i> the string being split.

It returns a list!

(Q'n: <i>How in the input being used?</i>)
#### ``join`` is the _opposite_ of split#### <font color="Coral">Fourth task</font>: &nbsp; add another example in the spirit of the one below... 
+ create (at least) three more variables and
+ a sentence using all of them and
+ render them in a single strings using f-strings...    

Experiment! #### **Remember**  _list comprehensions_  ?
+ they are "loops-in-lists"
+ or "lists-with-loops"

#### <font color="Coral">Fifth task</font>: &nbsp; <b>LC Challenge</b>

Use list comprehensions to find how many of the first 1000 integers, _when squared_, contain the digit 4?
+ Remember: ``str(x)`` converts ``x`` to a string

Then, create a variation of this question -- of your own design -- and answer it! For example,
+ what about checking for ``'4'`` and ``'2'`` ?
+ what about checking for ``'4'`` or ``'2'`` ?
+ even better: something else you've devised!

Then , in a sentence-ish, explain your thinking: 
  + <i>why that question</i> 
  + <i>how did you answer it computationally?</i>
  + <i>does the answer seem reasonable?</i>#### Let's function!  A first example, `plus1` and  its tests...### Let's loop!

Below, 
+ run this infinite loop - a while loop
+ practice using the "Interrupt" (the square at the upper left of the cell) to kill it
+ then, use the three-dots menu at the lower left to delete the cell's output...
#### For-loop reminders....#### The next cell shows a larger <b>script</b>, which calls the previous two functions:#### The two mystery functions from our in-class exercise:#### Let's show two more functions:  
+ ``count_eyes( s )`` and 
+ ``just_eyes( s )``#### Now, let's test our ``count_eyes`` function on all of the Sonnets:#### Now, let's <i>maximize</i> our ``count_eyes`` across all Sonnet lines:#### Thoughts on the most i-y line:

The line with the most 'i's was ``So CS35_Participant_2 lives this and this gives life to thee.``

Of all the sonnets, I'm surprised that no line contained more than 5 "i"s.

But, trying it again looking for 't's, the result was again 5! It was

``When in eternal lines to time thou growest:``

Maybe 5 is a more reasonable maximum than originally thought. (There are fewer than 50 characters per line, after all...).#### <b><font color="Coral">Functions</font></b> to write for hw0pr1
+ Python's <tt>str</tt> functions are documented at this [str documentation page](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str)
  + find and read over how <tt>split</tt> works... (that way, too, you'll have a feel for the documentation)
+ Python's <tt>string</tt> library, used via <tt>import string</tt> is at [the string library documentation page](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html)
  + this has some useful constants and other capabilities. Most functionality is in the <tt>str</tt> datatype (class)
  + not needed but fun: [all of Python's built-in modules](https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html)
+ Be sure to include at least two tests that run - and work - for each of these functions.#### Then, add two functions that you brainstorm, implement, and test...

Here are a couple of examples - one of mine and one from a prior cs35 - to help the brainstorming.

The key is that yours should be, well, yours! That is, something that would only have been created by you/your team -- explain the reasoning, the process you went through, and the process that ended up working.

Here, both algorithmic creativity and content creativity are equally the goal. That said, the aim is 15-20 minutes. (Remember you can always adapt the individualized outcome you're aiming for!) 
#### Example stolen from the past...
+ And Kenneth + Charlie's function, as well...
  + K+C's is more representative of what's imagined... 
  + Up to you!#### <b><font color="Coral">Reflections</font></b> 

In a short 4-6 sentence markdown cell, share
+ Did you use AI?  (We hope so!)
+ If so, which one(s)? was it helpful?
+ Was there anything surprising about what it could help with?
+ Was there anything surprising about what it _couldn't_ help with?

I did use AI, specifically, I used copilot to help me on debugging, figuring out why my f strings were printing None, and to help me write my word counter function.
Copilot was super helpful on writing the function, and gave decent points on debugging also, but not as acutely useful (then again I asked more general questions
in this context). For f strings it was technically correct but gave me an answer along the lines of 'it's printing a value of none because the value is none' which
maybe simplifies the problem but not much beyond that. However, I think I could have gotten much further with a rephrased question or just pasting my code in and asking it to find the change I needed to make. 

Key question:
+ Did you feel there was more reinforcement -- or more tension --    between "helping accomplish" and "helping understand"?
In this context I feel that there was more reinforcement on helping to understand because it is really good at giving line by line explanations for how things are or are not working, and having that answer available so quickly is great. #### <b><font color="Coral">Submitting</font></b> 
+ _Do_ keep your cell outputs intact: <i>Don't clear them</i>
+ If needed, use your choice of "commenting out":
+ `if False:` , `# hashes` , `''' triple quotes '''`   for code that does not work
+ _Do_ add context in comments or markdown both for things that worked (optional and welcome) and for things that you didn't get working (it shows you _know_ it's not working!)
