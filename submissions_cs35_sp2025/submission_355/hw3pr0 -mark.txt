Problem 0:   <i>LLMs as prose "meta-programming" </i>   (hw3pr0.ipynb)  

Today's article:

+ [here from the original source (the Economist, June 26, 2024)](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2024/06/26/at-least-10-of-research-may-already-be-co-authored-by-ai) 

<br>

Titled <u>At least 10% of research may already be co-authored by AI</u>, this Economist article reports on the extent LLMs are being used as "meta-programming" tools for research prose, comparing disciplines, languages, and - fun - particular words that LLMs seem to use disproportionally much. Take a look and then...

<br>

Consider the pros, cons, and evolving policies:
+ <b><font color="DodgerBlue">pros</font></b> &nbsp;&nbsp;   "They can breathe life into dense scientific prose and speed up the drafting process, especially for non-native English speakers."  <br><br>
+ <b><font color="DodgerBlue">cons</font></b> &nbsp;&nbsp;  "Scientific papers rely on the precise communication of uncertainty, where the capabilities of LLMs remain murky. Hallucinations -- whereby LLMs confidently assert fantasies -- remain common, as does a tendency to regurgitate other peopleâ€™s words, verbatim, [unchecked](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/not-gouda-nough-google-removes-ai-generated-cheese-error-from-super-bowl-ad/), and without attribution." <br><br>
+ <b><font color="DodgerBlue">policies</font></b> &nbsp;&nbsp;  "Some journals ban it outright. Others have changed their minds." 

<br>

From there, create a short reflection, drawing from your own experiences, on a personally interesting subset of these prompts:
+ **(a)** where you think norms for meta-programmed prose  will converge in the coming 2-3 years?   and/or 
+ **(b)** where you think norms for meta-programmed prose  should converge in the coming 2-3 years?  and/or
+ **(c)** whether or not you feel different when encountering human-vs-GPT written prose?     and/or
+ **(d)** what strategies you, personally, use to distinguish work by a human vs work by AI... ?

As with each week's reading, responses should be carefully considered, but need not be very CS35_Participant_2 (~5 or so sentences is wonderful).
