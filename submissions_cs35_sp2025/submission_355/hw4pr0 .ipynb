    "I think the first proposed law--that AIs must obey human society's laws--is a super interesting one. There are some laws that seem easier to program than others. For example, having an autonomous car stop at a red light seems straightforward enough. However, other laws are much harder, for example that it is against the law to threaten another person. I personally believe that AI cannot 'learn' was threatening is. It can be trained to identify words or phrases that are usually labeled as threatening, but because it does not have human vulnerabilities or fears, it will never fully understand what a threat is. So it could generate text that I may perceive as threatening, but have no awareness or intention of that. Even with additional training to make the output of a threatening (or otherwise illegal) statement less and less likely, it seems impossible to enforce certain laws, let alone hold the right entity accountable. Overall, I agree with the principle, but do not see it as implementable. "
