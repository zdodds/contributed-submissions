#### Births Modeler: &nbsp; Using Decision Trees and Random Forests

+ births clasification via decision trees and random forests...
+ You're classifying "above" (above-median popularity of birthdays) vs "below" (below-median popularity of birthdays)
+ Feel free to re-use the cleaned data from previous weeks (already here)
+ Suggestion:  &nbsp; go cell-by-cell using the iris_modeler example, copying-and-adapting as you go...## Data set up...
+ Use the cleaned data from prior weeks (it should be here in this folder as births_cleaned.csv)
+ Be sure to get rid of the column with the **number of births** &nbsp;&nbsp; That makes the prediction "too easy"!
+ Instead, see how well the DT/RF techniques can predict above/below-median popularity, just based on month and day...
+ (It's quite a hard estimation problem!)## First: &nbsp; _Decision Trees_## Then: &nbsp; _Random Forests_<br>

### Final, big-picture question:  
+ What are the relative "feature importances" of the two features
  + month
  + day
+ ... at least, in terms of "birthday popularity," as we've defined it?

Reflect, in a sentence or two, on the values of feature importances that you found.
+ To use Erica Thompson's framing, 
+ how much trust (or weight) would you attribute to this model and its feature importances, "outside of Model Land"?
