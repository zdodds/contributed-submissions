# # install gensim


# the word-embeddings are in the large file word2vec_model.txt

# make sure that file is here:



#
# this function, read_word2vec_model, wraps the creation of a gensim model, let's say, m
#
#      to use it, run the line   m = read_word2vec_model()

#
m.get_vector('snake')   # m.get_vector('queen')  m.get_vector('snake')   m.get_vector('king')

# which are not very useful ... until we compare them to other meanings:


# let's see the built-in similarity method
m.similarity('python','snake')   # should be .6606292...

# the dot product is available in the numpy library

# we can use np to find the angle, in degrees, between the two vectors :-)
deg = np.degrees(np.arccos(0.66063))  # dot is cosine; converting from radians to degrees
print(f"...which is {deg:7.2f} degrees")

# for unit vectors, "dot product" is the same as the "cosine similarity"  
#     which is the cos of the angle between the two vectors


# let's again see the built-in similarity method:
m.similarity('python','snake')   # should be the same .6606292...


m.distance( 'python', 'snake' )   # the distance is 1 minus the similarity


m.distance( 'python', 'coffee' )   # let's see...

# notice that the values provide a starting-point to _quantify_ the bias in the dataset
# quantifying dataset bias is currently a very active area of research
# it would also be possible to compare both of these with 
print()
simprs = m.similarity("programmer","person")    # try it!
print(f"similarity w 'person': {simprs:7.3f}")


#
# the dataset will reflect the biases of the training data / source-texts  (6b tokens from google news)
#
# for task#2, as you explore possibilities, see if there is a way for the similarity-scores to quantify the biases present...
# 
# key constraint: lots of tokens are missing...


# let's compare multiple similarities:

python_snake = m.similarity('python','snake')
python_coffee = m.similarity('python','coffee')

#
# let's define an "odd-one-out" from any collection of words, 
# simply by considering all possible similarities (and adding them up for each word)

"""
here, for example:

python_snake  similarity: .66
python_coffee similarity: .02

so, summing the similarities for each word separately:
  python:  .66 + .02 == .68
  coffee:  .08 + .02 == .10
