<hr>#### Reading for hw2...     (hw2pr0.ipynb)


<br>
Problem 0:      <i><b>(When)  Is webscraping legal and/or ethical?     [10 pts]</b></i>

This week's reading includes 1++ short articles:
+ The first article  is entitled, [Is Web Scraping Ethical](https://scrapeops.io/web-scraping-playbook/ethics-of-web-scraping/) by ScrapeOps.io (they're not impartial: they're a webscraping-tools company!)

<br>

+ The "+" article is Meta's [Facebook Terms of Service](https://www.facebook.com/terms.php).  (Perhaps this should be the "+1" article?)
  + We're definitely _not_ asking you to read the whole Facebook/Meta ToS!  Rather, find your way to Section 3, Subsection 2 ***"What you can share and do on Meta."***   It's relatively short: it's one "screenful." 
  + The one sub-sub-section to consider especially carefully is 3.2.3.

<br>

+ In addition, we share this _flowchart_ of webscraping, from [this article by Sophie Chou of the MIT Media Lab and Pro Publica](https://www.storybench.org/to-scrape-or-not-to-scrape-the-technical-and-ethical-challenges-of-collecting-data-off-the-web/) (you need not read the article - if you do open it, notice the first line of the <i>above-the-fold</i> Python script!)

Then, in response to these resources, reflect on any <u>one of these three prompts</u>:   
+ (**Prompt A**) Look over Sophie Chiu's "Should you scrape?" flowchart. Find one decision node that you particularly agree -- or disagree -- with and elaborate on why. (Feel free to note whether you feel this hw adheres to the chart!)  
+ (**Prompt B**) At the end of the first article there is a set of "Principles for Responsible Scraping" Looking that over, find one principle you particularly agree -- or disagree -- with and elaborate on why.  
+ (**Prompt C**) Having read some of Facebook's ToS, consider its stated requirement "You may not access or collect data from our Products using automated means..."  Elaborate on what you think "automated means" includes -- and doesn't include.   

<br>

As with each week's reading, responses should be carefully considered, but need not be very CS35_Participant_2 (~5 or so sentences is wonderful).  

<hr>#### Reading response

(Feel free to use this cell for your response.)(**Prompt B**) At the end of the first article there is a set of "Principles for Responsible Scraping" Looking that over, find one principle you particularly agree -- or disagree -- with and elaborate on why. 

I particularly agree with the principle: "I will scrape with the goal of creating value with your data, not simply duplicating it."

From my understanding, simply duplicating data can increase the risk of exposing a companyâ€™s private information to a wider audience, potentially leading to unnecessary panic, criticism, or misleading trends. Companies that do not provide a publicly available API may have legitimate reasons for doing so, such as managing their data carefully to ensure that the information shared is accurate and prevents misunderstandings. (Of course, there may be exceptions where companies choose to hide unethical practices.)

A responsible scraper should be aware of the potential impact of the data they collect, perhaps even more so than the general public. It is essential for scrapers to consider how the public might benefit from the data, whether by providing more accurate information sources, improving access to educational resources, or fostering a better understanding of various companies. Scraping with the intention of creating value ensures that the data serves a meaningful purpose rather than contributing to unnecessary noise or harm.
