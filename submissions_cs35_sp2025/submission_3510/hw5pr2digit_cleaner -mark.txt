### <font color="DodgerBlue">hw5pr2 digits cleaner</font>

Suggestions:
+ set up this file and the example iris_cleaner (or your births_cleaner) file side-by-side...
+ for each cell, copy it over...
   + edit it and make adjustments to suit the births problem (as needed)
   + run it to make sure it works... and you obtain your cleaned digits data.

Hints:
+ This data set is almost completely clean -- ***tidy*** in data-science parlance 
+ So, the goal of this is building familiarity. 
+ That is, no new tricks or situations are added here...#### We read in the data from `digits.csv`#### Let's view our dataframe, `df`### There are a few items to clean...### dropping columns (using their indices)
It seems that there's nothing left to be cleaned### Converting columns so that they are <u>numeric</u>
+ We create a new column, <tt>irisnum</tt>, which will be numeric instead of a string
+ the `sklearn` library needs numeric data to build models
