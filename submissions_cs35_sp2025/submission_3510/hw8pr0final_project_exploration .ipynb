        "Previously I was thinking about developing a program that literally helps you untangeling a knot you draw using Reidmeister moves, which are fundamental moves developed by a mathematician called Reidmeister that help you untangeling a knot or transforming a knot in math. I've also discussed this with my math professor. However, a very important idea behind Reidmeister moves is the adoption of free groups, which, informally speaking, is about attmeping expressing a knot using a word like \"ababab\" or \"abcb^{-1}c\", where each letter is a generator of the group, and different combinations of the letters refer to different types of crossings in the knot. To figure out these complicated things may take up a lot of time, and maybe it's just out of my capability to encorporate all these at one time in my program, especially considering that I'm overloading this semester.\n",

        "Therefore, I switched to a program about separating the sound of the orchestra and the sound of piano to derive only the piano part or the orchestra part of a piano concerto. This could be extended to other musical pieces like separating the sound of the orchestra and the violin for a violin sonata, or, even more challenging, separating the sound of two pianos given a double piano concerto.\n",
        "\n",
        "At this point, I've only looked up for some libraries about separating different components of a music pieces like spleeter and nussl, but I haven't conducted tests about these libraries. I plan to first try some relatively easier piano concertos like piano concerto from Bach and Mozart and see how these libraries work and what I can improve. Later, I will test these libraries with some more complicated piano concertos like piano concertos from Chopin and Rachmaninoff and see what I can improve. If my program works well for the piano concerto, I may try concertos for other instruments or even double piano concertos. "
