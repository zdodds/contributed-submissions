Problem 0:   <i>LLMs as prose "meta-programming" </i>   (hw3pr0.ipynb)  

Today's article:

<br>

Titled <u>At least 10% of research may already be co-authored by AI</u>, this Economist article reports on the extent LLMs are being used as "meta-programming" tools for research prose, comparing disciplines, languages, and - fun - particular words that LLMs seem to use disproportionally much. Take a look and then...

<br>

Consider the pros, cons, and evolving policies:
+ <b><font color="DodgerBlue">pros</font></b> &nbsp;&nbsp;   "They can breathe life into dense scientific prose and speed up the drafting process, especially for non-native English speakers."  <br><br>
+ <b><font color="DodgerBlue">cons</font></b> &nbsp;&nbsp;  "Scientific papers rely on the precise communication of uncertainty, where the capabilities of LLMs remain murky. Hallucinations -- whereby LLMs confidently assert fantasies -- remain common, as does a tendency to regurgitate other peopleâ€™s words, verbatim, [unchecked](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/not-gouda-nough-google-removes-ai-generated-cheese-error-from-super-bowl-ad/), and without attribution." <br><br>
+ <b><font color="DodgerBlue">policies</font></b> &nbsp;&nbsp;  "Some journals ban it outright. Others have changed their minds." 

<br>

From there, create a short reflection, drawing from your own experiences, on a personally interesting subset of these prompts:
+ **(a)** where you think norms for meta-programmed prose  will converge in the coming 2-3 years?   and/or 
+ **(b)** where you think norms for meta-programmed prose  should converge in the coming 2-3 years?  and/or
+ **(c)** whether or not you feel different when encountering human-vs-GPT written prose?     and/or
+ **(d)** what strategies you, personally, use to distinguish work by a human vs work by AI... ?

(a) Where you think norms for meta-programmed prose will converge in the coming 2-3 three years?

Because I primarily use AI tools for academic discussions, my perspective may be somewhat biased. I believe meta-programmed prose will likely evolve in two significant ways: reducing instances of hallucination and increasing transparency about the AIâ€™s underlying purpose and data processing methods.

Regarding transparency, I expect that AI developers will begin to clearly disclose the persona or knowledge base their systems emulate, as well as explain how user data is processed. The additional clarity could help alleviate concerns about privacy and ensure users understand the AIâ€™s operational framework.

The challenge of hallucinations, however, may be more difficult to overcome. In my view, hallucinations are an inherent byproduct of the "studying process" of AI, making them hard to eliminate entirely. Maybe further research into the origins of these hallucinationsâ€”or the development of improved training techniques to minimize themâ€”could lead to meaningful progress. Even with this issue, AI remains a valuable tool for research: it can offer novel ideas and insights, though it is essential to verify these contributions independently since they may sometimes be inaccurate.<br>

As with each week's reading, responses should be carefully considered, but need not be very CS35_Participant_2 (~5 or so sentences is wonderful).
