# Let's import the regular expression library (it should be built-in)

# REs are a whole language! 
# Let's see a strategic use, to get our snacks from the snack_page above:
import re

# Let's try some smaller examples to build up to the snack_page example:

# fundamental capabilities:  regex matching and substitution  
#
#    the regex:
#      matcher:    replacer:   in this string:
re.sub(r"Harvey",  "Mildred",  "Harvey Mudd")           # the 'r' is for 'raw' strings. They're best for re's.


re.sub(r"car", "cat",  "This car is careful!")          # we'll stick with substitution for now...  uh oh!  space or ,1


re.sub(r"d", "dd", "Harvey Mud")          # try "Mildred Mudd"


# ANCHORS:  Patterns can be anchored:   $ meand the _end_
re.sub(r"d$", "dd", "Mildred Mud" )   # $ signifies (matches) the END of the line


# ANCHORS:  Patterns can be anchored:   ^  means the _start_ 
re.sub(r"^M", "‚Ñ≥", "Mildred Mudd" )   # ^ signifies (matches) the START of the line  (unicode M :)


# PLUS  +   means one or more:
re.sub(r"i+", "i", "Isn't the aliiien skiing this weekend? AiiiIIIiiiiIIIeee!" )   # try replacing with "" or "I" or "ùíæ" or "‚ìò"


# SquareBrackets  [iI]  mean any from that character group:
re.sub(r"[Ii]+", "i", "Isn't the aliiien skiing this weekend? AiiiIIIiiiiIIIeee!" )   # it can vary within the group!


# SquareBrackets allow ranges, e.g., [a-z]
re.sub(r"[a-z]", "*", "Aha! You've FOUND my secret: 42!")       # use a +,  add A-Z, show \w, for "word" character


# Let's try the range [0-9] and +
re.sub(r"[0-9]+", "42",  "Aliens <3 pets! They have 45 cats, 6 lemurs, and 789 manatees!")   # DISCUSS!  no +? How to fix?!


re.sub( r"or", "and", "words or phrases" )
re.sub( r"s", "-", "words or phrases" )
re.sub( r"[aeiou]", "-", "words or phrases" )

re.sub( r"$", " [end]", "words or phrases" )
re.sub( r"^", "[start] ", "words or phrases" )

# Challenge! The dot . matches _any_ single character:  
re.sub( r".", "-", "words or phrases" )   # What will this do?

re.sub( r".s", "-S", "words or phrases" )  # And this one?!

re.sub( r".+s", "-S", "words or phrases" )  # And this one?!!


# The star (asterisk) matches ZERO or more times...
re.sub(r"42*", "47", "Favorite #'s:  4 42 422 4222 42222 422222")       # try + {2}  {1,3}   (42)


m = re.findall(r'<li class="snack">(.*)</li>', snack_page )   # parens are a "capture group"   # try w/o it  # try search & sub
                                                   # each set of parents "captures" the text inside it
print(f"{m = }")                                   # it can even be used later, as \1, \2, \3, etc.

# Claremont's Colleges - MARKDOWN version

The Claremont Colleges are a *consortium* of **five** SoCal institutions. <br>
We list them here.

## The 5Cs: a list
+ [Pomona](https://www.pomona.edu/)
+ [CMC](https://www.cmc.edu/)
+ [Pitzer](https://www.pitzer.edu/)
+ [Scripps](https://www.scrippscollege.edu/)
+ [HMC](https://www.hmc.edu/)

The above's an _unordered_ list.  <br>
At the 5Cs, we all agree there's __no__ order!

Are there _other_ schools in Claremont?

### Claremont destinations
+ _Pepo Melo_, a fantastic font of fruit!
+ **Starbucks**, the center of Claremont's "city," not as good as Scripps's _Motley_ 
+ ***Sancho's Tacos***, the village's newest establishment
+ ~~In-and-out CS35_Participant_3~~ (not in Claremont, alas, but close! CMC-supported!)
+ `42`nd Street Bagel, an HMC fave, definitely _well-numbered_
+ Trader Joe's, providing fuel for the walk back to Pitzer _from Trader Joe's_
