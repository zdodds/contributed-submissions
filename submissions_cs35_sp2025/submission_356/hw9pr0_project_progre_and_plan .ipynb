Inspired by ISS_distance from week2 or using maps to calculate home to each airport being considered, then predicting the price of rideshare rides or calculating the cost of gas for the trip to the airport, adding that to the cost of the flights to inform user which flight to take. This is particularly meant for cost minimization, but of course time is also of the essence. E.g. Travelling from Claremont to LAX for a cheaper flight or CMC to ONT for a more expensive flight- Ubers to and from LAX are costly so will see if that ride+flight trip is <i>really</i> cheaper overall. Time commitment is definitely a no go for LAX vs ONT from Claremont. \n",
