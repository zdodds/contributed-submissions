# warning:  when cd does work, the _whole notebook_ has changed what it considers
#           its "current directory"  you'll see this here:



# and, we need to be able to move "up" or "outward"!
# to do this, use   #     here, in jupyter:




# we can keep going!   # "goes up" one directory level



# you don't need a new cell each time...



# really, each notebook cell is a script, sharing state with the others

# here, our code is guarded by an if true:

if false:

# there's no need to change the printing, because it won't print...

# when submitting notebooks, we ask you to submit notebooks that run...
# however, feel free to keep any+all non-running code! simply comment it out
# for example, with if false:
# hashtags and """ triple-quoted strings """ also work ...
