    "I think the norms for meta-programmed prose should focus on establishing AI as a tool, allowing us to reach and extend the **potential** of our work. I used to avoid using LLMs because I simply didn't \"trust\" it, but I realized that if I didn't start learning how to use it appropriately and effectively, I'd risk falling behind. I now primarily use AI to edit, summarize, and explain **crucial** concepts, which aids my own learning and helps me reach deeper **insights** more quickly. It's definitely interesting to see how the need to reframe my understanding of AI has converged to what seems to be the norm- AI in every day applications. I think the introduction of OpenAI's Operator, although with different use cases to creating prose, will be **pivotal** in reframing or some might say correcting the notion and use of AI. We're entering another *realm*! It'll be interesting to see how the use cases for AI extends, develops, and becomes more **intricate**. I'll be attending Peter Langland-Hassan's Ath Talk \"Why AI is (Probably) Creative, and Why Thatâ€™s OK\" and hope to **delve** more into this topic."
