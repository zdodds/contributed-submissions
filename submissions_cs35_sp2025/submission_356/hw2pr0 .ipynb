    "I agree with this statement, which directly speaks into the ethics of web scraping and ownership. Similar to the AI credit blame asymmetry, I believe that whether the act of web scraping is ethical or not is left at human judgment call. That is, if a knowledgeable web scraper is confidently willing and able to be transparent about using a web scraper in producing their work, the act is likely to be ethical. Like many things made illegal, restricting web scraping will only make it a bad practice. Given the verdict that web scraping is now a fact of life, website owners (and whoever authority is responsible for the modern internet!) might instead instill responsible web scraping and accountability, ultimately making it safe, making it knowledge to know the repurcussion cost simparts on experience etc.  What if all website owners were required to enable or at the very least consider exposing a public API (Principals for a Ethical Website Owner)? Of course, privacy concerns are another issue. "
