#
# if you _don't_ have the requests library, let's install it!
#

# for me, it worked to uncomment and run this command, here in this cell:

# an alternative is to run, in a terminal, the command would be 
#  #3 install requests  or    # install requests      (the ! is needed only if inside python)

# it's very system-dependent how much you have to "restart" in order to use
# the new library (the notebook, vscode, the jupyter extension, etc.)

# troubles?  let us know!  we'll work on it with you...


#
# hopefully, this now works! (if so, running will succeed silently)
#

import requests


#
# let's try it on a simple webpage
#

#
# we assign the url and obtain the api-call result into result
#    note that result will be an object that contains many fields (not a simple string)
# 

url = "https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~dodds/demo.html"
result = requests.get(url)
result    

# if it succeeded, you should see <response [200]>
# see the list of http reponse codes for the full set!


#
# when exploring, you'll often obtain an unfamiliar object. 
# here, we'll ask what type it is 
type(result)


# here is one of the data members within the result
# it "remembers" (keeps track of) the url requested:
result.url


# we can print all of the data members in an object with dir
# since dir returns a list, we will grab that list and loop over it:
all_fields = dir(result)

for field in all_fields:
    if "_" not in field: 
        print(field)


#
# let's try printing a few of those fields (data members): 
print(f"result.url         is {result.url}")  # the original url
print(f"result.raw         is {result.raw}")  # another object!
print(f"result.encoding    is {result.encoding}")  # utf-8 is very common
print(f"result.status_code is {result.status_code}")  # 200 is success!


# in this case, the result is a text file (html) let's see it!
contents = result.text
print(contents)


# yay!  
# this shows that you are able to "scrape" an arbitrary html page... 

# now, we're off to more _structured_ data-gathering...


#
# we assign the url and obtain the api-call result into result
#    note that result will be an object that contains many fields (not a simple string)
# 

import requests

url = "http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json"   # this is sometimes called an "endpoint" ...
result = requests.get(url)
result    

# if it succeeds, you should see <response [200]>


#
# let's try printing those shorter fields from before:
print(f"result.url         is {result.url}")  # the original url
print(f"result.raw         is {result.raw}")  # another object!
print(f"result.encoding    is {result.encoding}")  # utf-8 is very common
print(f"result.status_code is {result.status_code}")  # 200 is success!


#
# in this case, we know the result is a json file, and we can obtain it that way:
json_contents = result.json()
print(json_contents)

# remember:  json_contents will be a _dictionary_


#
# let's re-remind ourselves how dictionaries work:

json_contents['message']       # challenge:  could we access the other components? what _types_ are they?!!


#
# in python, we can use the resulting dictionary... let's see its keys:
print(list(json_contents.keys()))  

# also, watch out for string vs. numeric types, e.g., for latitude and longitude.
# at heart, _all_ web data are strings... .

# these experiments will be helpful for problem 1, below :)


# json is a javascript dictionary format -- almost the same as a python dictionary:
data = { 'key':'value',  'fave':42,  'list':[5,6,7,{'mascot':'aliiien'}] }
print(data)

# we can write in json format to a local file, named small42.json:
import json 

with open("small.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump( data, f )


# we can also read from a json file
# the resulting data will be a _dictionary_:

with open("small.json", "r") as f:
    dictionary = json.load( f )

print(f"the {dictionary = }")


# let's access this dictionary -- first, the keys:
list(dictionary.keys())   # how do we get 'aliiien' from newdata?


# task: use the dictionary to obtain (a) 'value' , (b) 42 , (c) 'aliiien'  [tricky!]

# remember that there are two ways to get the value from a key:
# way 1:  dictionary['key']            # errors if 'key' isn't present
# way 2:  dictionary.get('key')        # returns none if 'key' isn't present

#a
dictionary['key']

#b
dictionary['fave']

#c
dictionary["list"][-1]["mascot"]
