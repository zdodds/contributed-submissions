# #our model indicates that month/day both have a huge impact on birth trends (seasonal patterns or days with high birth rate). however, real world factors like cultural norms or big events happening in the world that play big roles are not considered. we should not rely too much on the model "outside of model land."

# in fact, the next task on this hw is to run at least one more ml workflow:
