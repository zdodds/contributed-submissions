# remember pwd? it's short for "print working directory"  (that is, your current folder)

# another important shell command:  ls (lists contents)



# the following cell shows cd, changing the current directory.
# we will also try # (to "move up" one level)

# warning:  when cd does work, the _whole notebook_ has changed what it considers
#           its "current directory"  you'll see this here:



# and, we need to be able to move "up" or "outward"!
# to do this, use   #     here, in jupyter:




# we can keep going!   # "goes up" one directory level



# you don't need a new cell each time...



# really, each notebook cell is a script, sharing state with the others

# here, our code is guarded by an if true:

if false:
    print(f"it was true!")

# try changing the true to false.
# there's no need to change the printing, because it won't print...

# when submitting notebooks, we ask you to submit notebooks that run...
# however, feel free to keep any+all non-running code! simply comment it out
# for example, with if false:
# hashtags and """ triple-quoted strings """ also work ...
# ... though they lose the code-structure and syntax highlighting! (as you see! :-)


# reminder: in each cell (script) all lines are run; only the last line is output
y = 58
x = y-7

# beware:  variables are global through the notebook!
