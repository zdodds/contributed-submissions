    "I agree with Isaac Asimov's law that AIs must disclose themselves as such as I have experienced it myself before and think it is crucial to regulate AI. In the text, it states that \"an A.I. system must clearly disclose that it is not human\" (Etzioni 2). This means that there should be a symbol or watermark that allows viewers to know for sure it was not human-created. In the modern world, it is hard for me to tell if pictures online are real or AI-generated, so having this rule will allow me to credit the real human creator."
